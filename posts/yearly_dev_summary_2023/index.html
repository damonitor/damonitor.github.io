As one more year has passed, I’d like to share that again for the second year of DAMON, with some events and statistics of this year’s DAMON development that I was personally interested in. I’d like to use this chance to say huge thanks to the community, too.\nSummary 2023 was yet another year of active and healthy DAMON development. DAMON has continued active development but hopefully further stabilized. The growth of the DAMON user-space tool, damo, was noticeable.\nDAMON has been explored and used by more people and products. ‘damo’ got its 100th GitHub star and has been deployed by seven major Linux distros. Four papers and three articles that explore and/or introduce DAMON have been published. A product that manages tiered memory using DAMON has officially been released.\nA substantial amount of development was also continued. Four major DAMON features have been developed. With a significant amount of new features, damo released its second major version (v2.0).\n24 people contributed their great code to DAMON by making 158 commits merged into the mainline. About 28% of the commits were made by Amazon-external contributors. Among the changes for DAMON’s parent subsystem, mm, about 9.35% of commits and 8.63% of changed lines were made for DAMON. About 0.21% of the commits for the whole Linux tree were made for DAMON. Six people contributed 1,872 commits to damo.\nCompared to 2022, the absolute number of contributors and changes for DAMON (kernel-only) has reduced (about 40%), though those relative to the numbers for its parent subsystem, mm, and the entire Linux tree were increased (about 10%) or not changed. Meanwhile, the numbers for damo have impressively increased to about 600% and 180% for contributors and changes, respectively.\nKey Events DAMON user-space tool, damo[2], got significant achievements in 2023. ‘damo’ has deployed via PyPI since August 2021, and ArchLinux started packaging it in March 2022[3]. In 2023, Fedora has been the second major Linux distro that packaging the tool since May[4]. The tool has been packaged by more distros, and as of this writing, ArchLinux, Debian, Devuan, Fedora, Kali Linux, Raspbian, and Ubuntu are[5] packaging the tool. It also got its 100th release[6] and GitHub star in August.\nA few articles and papers introducing or exploring DAMON have been published. Two LWN articles[7,8] that each briefly introduces a new feature of DAMON as a significant change of a new Linux kernel release, and shares detailed LSFMM DAMON discussion, were published in March and May. A blog post[9] from Hocus that introduces DAMON as a way to reduce memory footprint on virtual machines together with free pages reporting was published in July. Two arXiv papers[10,11] and one SOSP paper[12] exploring DAMON on tiered memory management were published in February, September, and October, respectively. One more paper from Intel that improves DAMON for terabyte-scale memory systems was published by ArXiv in November[13].\nWe shared the development status and plans with other kernel developers at LSFMM[14] and Kernel Summit track of LinuxPlumbers[15] in May and November, respectively. We introduced DAMON at a high level for wider audiences at the Open Source Summit North America[16] and Europe[17] in May and September, respectively. In LinuxPlumbers, we had the second in-person DAMON community meetup[18].\nDAMON community started participating[19] in the stable kernels release candidates testing in August.\nSK Hynix released[28] their second major version of the Heterogeneous Memory Software Development Kit (HMSDK), which uses DAMON for their CXL-based tiered memory management, in December.\nA more exhaustive list of events in 2023 is available on the DAMON news web page[29].\nKey Features We started 2023 with Linux v6.2 which delivered DAMOS tried regions feature[20] that was developed in 2022.\nDAMOS filters[21] feature has been developed and merged in the mainline by v6.3-rc1, which was released in March. The feature was later expanded[22] for more use cases and merged in the mainline by v6.6-rc1, which was released in September.\nTwo more DAMON features for pseudo-moving average-based reliable and speedy DAMON snapshot generation[23] and DAMOS-dedicated apply time interval[24] have been developed and merged in the mainline by v6.7-rc1, which was released in November.\nFinally, we developed user feedback-based DAMOS aggressiveness auto-tuning[25], which is currently merged in the mm tree. Hopefully, it will be merged in the mainline by v6.8-rc1, which is expected to be released in January 2024.\nDevelopment Statistics To appreciate and list all names of people who made DAMON available, and to quantify what 2023 was for DAMON development, I collected some numbers using my humble and buggy scripts. The scripts are available as open source[26,27].\nPlease note that numbers don’t say everything. Nonetheless, in my humble opinion, those are better than nothing and fun ;)\nContributors According to the humble script, 24 people have contributed to DAMON development in 2023 (v6.2-rc1..v6.7-rc8).\n$ ./lazybox/git_helpers/authors.py ./linux \\ --commits_range v6.2-rc1..v6.7-rc8 --skip_merge_commits \\ --linux_subsystems \"DATA ACCESS MONITOR\" 1.

That’s hopefully because DAMON code has more stabilized.\nFor the DAMON user-space tool, damo, six people contributed 1,859 commits in 2023. Note that there were contributors using multiple email addresses.\n$ ./lazybox/git_helpers/authors.py ./damo --since 2023-01-01 1. SeongJae Park : 1788 commits 2. SeongJae Park : 58 commits 3.

I’d call this a huge increase.\nPlease note that there were many unsung hero contributors gave valuable inputs, discussions, and many more things for DAMON development. So shameful that I cannot put everyone’s name here.\nThank you so much to all the awesome contributors!\nContributions from non-maintainer The maintainer, SJ (sj@kernel.org), has driven the development of DAMON, but the help from the community was huge. About 28.31% of DAMON commits have been made by people other than SJ. Again, the number is reduced compared to that of last year (33% -\u003e 28%).\n$ ./damon-hack/stat_damon_portion_community_commits.sh \\ ./linux ./damon-hack/stat_branches_2023 range from_sj non_sj non_sj_portion v6.2-rc1..v6.3 32 16 33.33% v6.3..v6.4 0 5 100.00% v6.4..v6.5 19 8 29.63% v6.5..v6.6 20 7 25.93% v6.6..v6.7-rc8 48 11 18.64% v6.2-rc1..v6.7-rc8 119 47 28.31% The output for 2022 was as below.\nrange from_sj non_sj non_sj_portion v5.15..v5.16 50 13 20.63% v5.16..v5.17 16 10 38.46% v5.17..v5.18 26 10 27.78% v5.18..v5.19 23 7 23.33% v5.19..v6.0 15 14 48.28% v6.0..v6.1 33 36 52.17% v6.1..v6.2-rc1 28 6 17.65% v5.15..v6.2-rc1 191 95 33.22% The Portion of DAMON Commits in MM and Linux To show how much change DAMON made to its parent subsystem, MM, and whole Linux, I counted the number of commits that touched files for DAMON, MM, and the whole Linux tree in 2023 releases (v6.2-rc1..v6.7-rc8).\nAccording to the buggy and humble script, about 9.35% of MM commits, and 0.21% of Linux commits were made for DAMON.\n$ ./damon-hack/stat_damon_portion_nr_commits.sh \\ ./linux ./damon-hack/stat_branches_2023 range damon mm damon/mm linux damon/linux v6.2-rc1..v6.3 47 458 10.26% 16273 0.29% v6.3..v6.4 5 346 1.45% 14835 0.03% v6.4..v6.5 26 327 7.95% 13561 0.19% v6.5..v6.6 25 402 6.22% 14069 0.18% v6.6..v6.7-rc8 55 341 16.13% 17138 0.32% v6.2-rc1..v6.7-rc8 158 1690 9.35% 75876 0.21% The output for 2022 was as below.\nrange damon mm damon/mm linux damon/linux v5.15..v5.16 45 307 14.66% 14190 0.32% v5.16..v5.17 17 223 7.62% 13038 0.13% v5.17..v5.18 29 448 6.47% 14954 0.19% v5.18..v5.19 24 399 6.02% 15134 0.16% v5.19..v6.0 15 283 5.30% 15402 0.10% v6.0..v6.1 61 536 11.38% 13942 0.44% v6.1..v6.2-rc1 20 250 8.00% 13687 0.15% v5.15..v6.2-rc1 211 2446 8.63% 100347 0.21% Compared to the numbers for 2022, absolute number of DAMON commits has reduced (211 -\u003e 158), but the proportion of DAMON commits against MM commits has a bit increased (8.63% -\u003e 9.35%), while the portion against Linux has not changed (0.21%).\nBy Number of Lines I further counted the portion of the number of changed lines. Didn’t count that for Linux here due to the slow speed of the script. The script argues about 4.05% of the changed lines for MM subsystem were for DAMON. This is a quite decrease compared to that of last year (14.32%). Hopefully, that’s because DAMON became more stabilized.\n$ ./damon-hack/stat_damon_portion_lines.sh \\ ./linux ./damon-hack/stat_branches_2023 range damon mm damon/mm v6.2-rc1..v6.3 962 13852 6.94% v6.3..v6.4 32 14226 0.22% v6.4..v6.5 113 9852 1.15% v6.5..v6.6 322 7862 4.10% v6.6..v6.7-rc8 850 10489 8.10% v6.2-rc1..v6.7-rc8 2279 56281 4.05% The output for 2022 was as below.\nrange damon mm damon/mm v5.15..v5.16 2157 8503 25.37% v5.16..v5.17 324 9370 3.46% v5.17..v5.18 3462 16288 21.25% v5.18..v5.19 929 10185 9.12% v5.19..v6.0 870 8665 10.04% v6.0..v6.1 1752 25844 6.78% v6.1..v6.2-rc1 3309 10544 31.38% v5.15..v6.2-rc1 12803 89399 14.32% Conclusion DAMON community delivered multiple important features and a significant amount of changes to the world via the collaboration between the 24 great contributors. I would call 2023 as yet another successful and grateful years of DAMON development.\nHuge thanks to you again, DAMON community. Looking forward to continuing our journey in 2024.\nHope you all enjoy the remaining holidays and a happy new year!\nThanks, SJ\nReferences [1] 2022 retrospect:

class=post-content><p>Hello,</p><p>Last year around this time, I shared a humble retrospect of DAMON for 2022[1],
which was effectively the first year it had after it was merged in the
mainline. As one more year has passed, I&rsquo;d like to share that again for the
second year of DAMON, with some events and statistics of this year&rsquo;s DAMON
development that I was personally interested in. I&rsquo;d like to use this chance
to say huge thanks to the community, too.</p><h1 id=summary>Summary<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#summary>#</a></h1><p>2023 was yet another year of active and healthy DAMON development. DAMON has
continued active development but hopefully further stabilized. The growth of
the DAMON user-space tool, damo, was noticeable.</p><p>DAMON has been explored and used by more people and products. &lsquo;damo&rsquo; got its
100th GitHub star and has been deployed by seven major Linux distros. Four
papers and three articles that explore and/or introduce DAMON have been
published. A product that manages tiered memory using DAMON has officially
been released.</p><p>A substantial amount of development was also continued. Four major DAMON
features have been developed. With a significant amount of new features, damo
released its second major version (v2.0).</p><p>24 people contributed their great code to DAMON by making 158 commits merged
into the mainline. About 28% of the commits were made by Amazon-external
contributors. Among the changes for DAMON&rsquo;s parent subsystem, mm, about 9.35%
of commits and 8.63% of changed lines were made for DAMON. About 0.21% of the
commits for the whole Linux tree were made for DAMON. Six people contributed
1,872 commits to damo.</p><p>Compared to 2022, the absolute number of contributors and changes for DAMON
(kernel-only) has reduced (about 40%), though those relative to the numbers for
its parent subsystem, mm, and the entire Linux tree were increased (about 10%)
or not changed. Meanwhile, the numbers for damo have impressively increased to
about 600% and 180% for contributors and changes, respectively.</p><h1 id=key-events>Key Events<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-events>#</a></h1><p>DAMON user-space tool, damo[2], got significant achievements in 2023. &lsquo;damo&rsquo;
has deployed via PyPI since August 2021, and ArchLinux started packaging it in
March 2022[3]. In 2023, Fedora has been the second major Linux distro that
packaging the tool since May[4]. The tool has been packaged by more distros,
and as of this writing, ArchLinux, Debian, Devuan, Fedora, Kali Linux,
Raspbian, and Ubuntu are[5] packaging the tool. It also got its 100th
release[6] and GitHub star in August.</p><p>A few articles and papers introducing or exploring DAMON have been published.
Two LWN articles[7,8] that each briefly introduces a new feature of DAMON as a
significant change of a new Linux kernel release, and shares detailed LSFMM
DAMON discussion, were published in March and May. A blog post[9] from Hocus
that introduces DAMON as a way to reduce memory footprint on virtual machines
together with free pages reporting was published in July. Two arXiv
papers[10,11] and one SOSP paper[12] exploring DAMON on tiered memory management
were published in February, September, and October, respectively. One more
paper from Intel that improves DAMON for terabyte-scale memory systems was
published by ArXiv in November[13].</p><p>We shared the development status and plans with other kernel developers at
LSFMM[14] and Kernel Summit track of LinuxPlumbers[15] in May and November,
respectively. We introduced DAMON at a high level for wider audiences at the
Open Source Summit North America[16] and Europe[17] in May and September,
respectively. In LinuxPlumbers, we had the second in-person DAMON community
meetup[18].</p><p>DAMON community started participating[19] in the stable kernels release
candidates testing in August.</p><p>SK Hynix released[28] their second major version of the Heterogeneous Memory
Software Development Kit (HMSDK), which uses DAMON for their CXL-based tiered
memory management, in December.</p><p>A more exhaustive list of events in 2023 is available on the DAMON news web
page[29].</p><h1 id=key-features>Key Features<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#key-features>#</a></h1><p>We started 2023 with Linux v6.2 which delivered DAMOS tried regions feature[20]
that was developed in 2022.</p><p>DAMOS filters[21] feature has been developed and merged in the mainline by
v6.3-rc1, which was released in March. The feature was later expanded[22] for
more use cases and merged in the mainline by v6.6-rc1, which was released in
September.</p><p>Two more DAMON features for pseudo-moving average-based reliable and speedy
DAMON snapshot generation[23] and DAMOS-dedicated apply time interval[24] have
been developed and merged in the mainline by v6.7-rc1, which was released in
November.</p><p>Finally, we developed user feedback-based DAMOS aggressiveness auto-tuning[25],
which is currently merged in the mm tree. Hopefully, it will be merged in the
mainline by v6.8-rc1, which is expected to be released in January 2024.</p><h1 id=development-statistics>Development Statistics<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#development-statistics>#</a></h1><p>To appreciate and list all names of people who made DAMON available, and to
quantify what 2023 was for DAMON development, I collected some numbers using my
humble and buggy scripts. The scripts are available as open source[26,27].</p><p>Please note that numbers don&rsquo;t say everything. Nonetheless, in my humble
opinion, those are better than nothing and fun ;)</p><h2 id=contributors>Contributors<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#contributors>#</a></h2><p>According to the humble script, 24 people have contributed to DAMON development
in 2023 (v6.2-rc1..v6.7-rc8).</p><pre><code>$ ./lazybox/git_helpers/authors.py ./linux \

</code></pre><p>The number has quite reduced compared to that of 2022 (40 -> 24). That&rsquo;s
hopefully because DAMON code has more stabilized.</p><p>For the DAMON user-space tool, damo, six people contributed 1,859 commits in
2023. Note that there were contributors using multiple email addresses.</p><pre><code>$ ./lazybox/git_helpers/authors.py ./damo --since 2023-01-01

percent (1,054 -> 1,872) and 600 percent (1 -> 6) respectively, compared to
those of 2022. I&rsquo;d call this a huge increase.</p><p>Please note that there were many unsung hero contributors gave valuable inputs,
discussions, and many more things for DAMON development. So shameful that I

the help from the community was huge. About 28.31% of DAMON commits have been
made by people other than SJ. Again, the number is reduced compared to that of
last year (33% -> 28%).</p><pre><code>$ ./damon-hack/stat_damon_portion_community_commits.sh \

that for Linux here due to the slow speed of the script. The script argues
about 4.05% of the changed lines for MM subsystem were for DAMON. This is a
quite decrease compared to that of last year (14.32%). Hopefully, that&rsquo;s
because DAMON became more stabilized.</p><pre><code>$ ./damon-hack/stat_damon_portion_lines.sh \
