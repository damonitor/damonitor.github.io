The aimed usages include NUMA hit/miss monitoring [2], Kernel Same page Merging scan target selection [3,4], cache aware CPU scheduling, live migration target VM selection [5], and general NUMA-aware pages migration [6].\nI posted its first working version as RFC v2 [7] about four months ago. After the posting, it got interests and tests publicly [5] and privately. RFC v2 was, however, a never upstreamable hack that was made for only showing if it can be implemented. For making it upstreamed, a significant amount of efforts are expected [8]. And after the posting, I was unfortunately unable to spend meaningful time on it due to other events and work. I received more continued interests in the work recently, and hence I’m trying to spend more time on it.\nThe Rough Plan The rough plan of it that I shared on DAMON blog [8] was just saying “it needs to be upstreamed and it will require a significant amount of effort”. So I’m sharing yet another rough plan here.\nThis work require multiple changes including\nextending DAMON for receiving access report from other subsystems (damon_report_access() [9]), making other subsystem who can capture origin CPU/writeness of accesses (e.g., page fault handler [10]) report the information to DAMON, extending DAMON for filtering the reports for origin CPU/writeness of accesses. The first part in the current implementation has many rooms to improve in terms of performance. I don’t think that’s upstreaming blocker though, unless some early testers find a problem of it. So I think this is not a blocker for this project, at least at the moment.\nFor the second part, I’m trying to modify the page fault handler, to use information like NUMA balancing hint faults. As Lorenzo pointed out on RFC v2, it needs to have clean and non disruptive design. Also this requires alignment of multiple stakeholders, including MM core and NUMA balancing maintainers. I think this is the biggest challenge of this project. Using other subsystems or features such as instruction sampling can be another way to go. But for general availability of it on any architecture and virtual machine internal cases, people I privately discussed preferred this fault based approach. I will try to make the alignment with the stakeholders, after the upcoming LPC [11]. Unless I make good progress on this part very quickly, I will propose an LSFMMBPF'26 [12] session for this. So hopefully we will make some alignment among the stakeholders by LSFMM. Hopefully we will get a more concrete upstreaming plan and timeline, at least after the LSFMM'26.\nThe third part in current implementation is very ugly. Especially its kernel API and user ABI need to be redesigned from the beginning. The interface is better to be stabilized sooner, as changes of the interface will make the early users/testers be confused and frustrated. I started working on this, and hopefully I will share RFC v3 of this project with the stabilized interface, by upcoming LPC'25.\nSummary and Message for User/Tester To summarize the major expected timeline here,\nBy LPC'25 (2025-12-13), another version having stabilized DAMON interface will be shared. By LSFMMBPF'26 (2026-05-06), an alignment on part 2 stakeholders will be made. After the alignment, a more clear plan will be made. If you are already using or testing RFC v2 of this project, please be aware the kernel API and user ABI will significantly be changed on the version that I am willing to share by LPC'25. It means if you are directly using or testing the features via the kernel API and/or user ABI, your usages or tests might need to be updated.\nThe support of the features on DAMON user-sapce tool (damo) is also experimental at the moment, and that will also be changed in more stable form in future. But, the experimental interface will support both before-LPC and after-LPC DAMON for the short term. Hence, if you are using or testing the features via DAMON user-space tool’s experimental interface, you will not need to make any change in the short term.\nPlease feel free to raise any questions or comments on the plan and the project.\nReferences [1] https://damonitor.github.io/posts/write_only_cpus_only_monitoring/\n[2] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/cover.1645024354.git.xhao@linux.alibaba.com/\n[3] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220203131237.298090-1-pedrodemargomes@gmail.com/\n[4] https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20250129044041.25884-1-pedrodemargomes@gmail.com/\n[5] https://lore.kernel.org/all/aJAfTUh-49pYuhbg@3c06303d853a/\n[6] https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2066/\n[7] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250727201813.53858-1-sj@kernel.org/\n[8] https://damonitor.github.io/posts/write_only_cpus_only_monitoring/#cautions-and-plan-to-drop-experimental-tag\n[9] https://lwn.net/Articles/1016525/\n[10] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250727201813.53858-6-sj@kernel.org/\n[11] https://lpc.events/event/19/\n[12] https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lsfmmbpf/\n","wordCount":"757","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://damonitor.github.io/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-11-28T11:47:34-08:00","dateModified":"2025-11-28T11:47:34-08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://damonitor.github.io/posts/damon_cpus_write_monitoring_rfc_v3_plan/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"DAMON Project Website","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://damonitor.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://damonitor.github.io/ accesskey=h title="damon (Alt + H)"><img src=https://damonitor.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>damon</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://damonitor.github.io/site_about title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://damonitor.github.io/posts/damon_news/ title=news><span>news</span></a></li><li><a href=https://damonitor.github.io/posts/damon_publications_talks/ title=talks/publications><span>talks/publications</span></a></li><li><a href=https://damonitor.github.io/posts/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://damonitor.github.io/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://damonitor.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://damonitor.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">A rough plan for CPUs/write-only monitoring RFC v3 and future</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-11-28 11:47:34 -0800 PST'>November 28, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;757 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Me&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/damonitor/damonitor.github.io/tree/master/blog_src/content/posts/damon_cpus_write_monitoring_rfc_v3_plan.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#the-rough-plan>The Rough Plan</a></li><li><a href=#summary-and-message-for-usertester>Summary and Message for User/Tester</a></li><li><a href=#references>References</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Updates after initial posting.</p><p>2026-01-13 update: The RFC v3 has
