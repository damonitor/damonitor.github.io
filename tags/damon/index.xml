      <description>The initial version of this post was initially posted to DAMON mailing list as https://lore.kernel.org/20241108232536.73843-1-sj@kernel.org
Posting it here too, for visibility and after-posting updates for any needs.
One of common issues that I received from DAMON users is that DAMON&amp;rsquo;s monitoring results show hot regions much less than expected. Specifically, the users find regions of only zero or low &amp;rsquo;nr_accesses&amp;rsquo; value from the DAMON-generated access pattern snapshots.
In some cases, it turned out the problem can be alleviated by tuning DAMON parameters or changing the way to interpret the results.</description>

      <description>I just made a DAMON logo using DAMON, like below.
$ git clone https://github.com/sjp38/masim &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd masim $ cat damon_pixel_2 11111111 11 11 111111 11111111 11 11 11111111 11111111 1111 11111111 11111111 11 11 11111111 11111111 1111 11111111 $ ./pixels_to_access_config.py ./damon_pixel_2 $((100*1024*1024)) 300 damon.cfg $ sudo damo record &amp;#34;./masim ./configs/stairs.cfg&amp;#34; $ sudo damo report heatmap --output damon.png The output is below:

      <description>This document helps you estimating the amount of benefit that you could get from DAMON-based system optimizations, and describes how you could achieve it.
Check The Signs No optimization can provide same extent of benefit to every case. Therefore you should first guess how much improvements you could get using DAMON. If some of below conditions match your situation, you could consider using DAMON.
Low IPC and High Cache Miss Ratios.</description>

      <description>DAMON is lightweight. It increases system memory usage by 0.39% and slows target workloads down by 1.16%.
DAMON is accurate and useful for memory management optimizations. An experimental DAMON-based operation scheme for THP, namely &amp;rsquo;ethp&amp;rsquo;, removes 76.15% of THP memory overheads while preserving 51.25% of THP speedup. Another experimental DAMON-based &amp;lsquo;proactive reclamation&amp;rsquo; implementation, namely &amp;lsquo;prcl&amp;rsquo;, reduces 93.38% of residential sets and 23.63% of system memory footprint while incurring only 1.22% runtime overhead in the best case (parsec3/freqmine).</description>

      <title>Summary of DAMON Development in 2022</title>

      <description>A summary of DAMON development in 2022 has posted: https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20221229171209.162356-1-sj@kernel.org/
2022 was a year of active and healthy DAMON development.
Seven new DAMON major features were delivered to users. Some of those were featured in articles and academic papers.
It was possible thanks to the DAMON community. The community has expanded with its own mailing list and an open bi-weekly chat series. 40 people contributed their great code to DAMON via making their 275 commits merged into the mainline.</description>

      <title>An example of DAMON usage for profiling</title>
      <link>https://damonitor.github.io/posts/damon_profile_callstack_example/</link>

      <guid>https://damonitor.github.io/posts/damon_profile_callstack_example/</guid>
      
      <description>I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t introduce a good, intuitive example use case of DAMON[0] for profiling so far, though DAMON is not for only profiling. One straightforward and realistic usage of DAMON as a profiling tool would be recording the monitoring results with callstack and visualize those by timeline together.
For example, below shows that visualization for a realistic workload, namely &amp;lsquo;fft&amp;rsquo; in SPLASH-2X benchmark suite. The upper-most graph shows how DAMON-detected working set size of the workload (y-axis) changes by time (x-axis).</description>

      <title>Tests package for DAMON is released under GPL v2</title>

      <description>DAMON contains a number of tests based on the kselftest and kunit in its patchset itself. As it is preferred to contain only tests having short runtime in kernel tree, I organized time consuming tests in a package and used it in my company only. Tests could be used as a good document and essential for contributors. For the reason, I promised I will make it open source in the last kernel summit talk (https://linuxplumbersconf.</description>

      <description>A DAMON showcase website[1] is open. There are

      <title>DAMON: Data Access Monitor</title>
      <link>https://damonitor.github.io/posts/damon/</link>

      <description>With increasingly data-intensive workloads and limited DRAM capacity, optimal memory management based on dynamic access patterns is becoming increasingly important. Such mechanisms are only possible if accurate and efficient dynamic access pattern monitoring is available.
DAMON is a Data Access MONitoring framework subsystem for the Linux kernel developed for such memory management. It is designed with some key mechanism (refer to Design for the detail) that make it
accurate (the monitoring output is useful enough for DRAM level memory management; It might not be appropriate for CPU Cache levels, though), light-weight (the monitoring overhead is low enough to be applied online), and scalable (the upper-bound of the overhead is in constant range regardless of the size of target workloads).</description>
