      <description>This document helps you estimating the amount of benefit that you could get from DAMON-based system optimizations, and describes how you could achieve it.
Check The Signs No optimization can provide same extent of benefit to every case. Therefore you should first guess how much improvements you could get using DAMON. If some of below conditions match your situation, you could consider using DAMON.
Low IPC and High Cache Miss Ratios.</description>

      <description>DAMON is lightweight. It increases system memory usage by 0.39% and slows target workloads down by 1.16%.
DAMON is accurate and useful for memory management optimizations. An experimental DAMON-based operation scheme for THP, namely &amp;rsquo;ethp&amp;rsquo;, removes 76.15% of THP memory overheads while preserving 51.25% of THP speedup. Another experimental DAMON-based &amp;lsquo;proactive reclamation&amp;rsquo; implementation, namely &amp;lsquo;prcl&amp;rsquo;, reduces 93.38% of residential sets and 23.63% of system memory footprint while incurring only 1.22% runtime overhead in the best case (parsec3/freqmine).</description>

      <description>A summary of DAMON development in 2022 has posted: https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20221229171209.162356-1-sj@kernel.org/
2022 was a year of active and healthy DAMON development.
Seven new DAMON major features were delivered to users. Some of those were featured in articles and academic papers.
It was possible thanks to the DAMON community. The community has expanded with its own mailing list and an open bi-weekly chat series. 40 people contributed their great code to DAMON via making their 275 commits merged into the mainline.</description>

      <description>DAMON contains a number of tests based on the kselftest and kunit in its patchset itself. As it is preferred to contain only tests having short runtime in kernel tree, I organized time consuming tests in a package and used it in my company only. Tests could be used as a good document and essential for contributors. For the reason, I promised I will make it open source in the last kernel summit talk (https://linuxplumbersconf.</description>

      <description>A DAMON showcase website[1] is open. There are
the official documentation of DAMON[2], the heatmap format dynamic access pattern of various realistic workloads for heap area[3], mmap()-ed area[4], and stack[5] area, the dynamic working set size distribution[6] and chronological working set size changes[7], and the latest performance test results[8].

      <title>DAMON: Data Access Monitor</title>
      <link>https://damonitor.github.io/posts/damon/</link>

      <description>With increasingly data-intensive workloads and limited DRAM capacity, optimal memory management based on dynamic access patterns is becoming increasingly important. Such mechanisms are only possible if accurate and efficient dynamic access pattern monitoring is available.
DAMON is a Linux kernel subsystem for such data access monitoring and access-aware system operations. It is designed with its key access monitroing mechanisms and a major feature called DAMOS, that make it
accurate (for DRAM level memory management), light-weight (enough to be applied online in production), scalable (keeps above properties regardless of memory size) and automated (tuning and access-aware memory maangement operations).</description>
