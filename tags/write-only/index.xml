      <description>Below is also sent as a mail to DAMON mailing list and relevant people.
I&amp;rsquo;m working [1] on extending DAMON to monitor accesses that are made by specific CPUs, and/or for writes. The aimed usages include NUMA hit/miss monitoring [2], Kernel Same page Merging scan target selection [3,4], cache aware CPU scheduling, live migration target VM selection [5], and general NUMA-aware pages migration [6].
I posted its first working version as RFC v2 [7] about four months ago.</description>

      <title>DAMON for Write-only or Given CPUs-only Monitoring</title>

      <description>2025-12-08 update: The RFC v3 is posted.
From the very early days of DAMON, there were attempts to extend it for cpus-aware monitoring and write-only monitoring.
In 2022, Xin Hao proposed extending DAMON for NUMA access statistics.
In 2022 and 2025, Pedro Demarchi Gomes proposed extending DAMON for writes-only monitoring.
Those proposals are not yet upstreamed though. We continued similar DAMON extension discussions publicly and privately, with multiple parties, though.</description>
