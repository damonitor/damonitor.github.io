      <description>This document helps you estimating the amount of benefit that you could get from DAMON-based system optimizations, and describes how you could achieve it.
Check The Signs No optimization can provide same extent of benefit to every case. Therefore you should first guess how much improvements you could get using DAMON. If some of below conditions match your situation, you could consider using DAMON.
Low IPC and High Cache Miss Ratios.</description>

      <description>DAMON is a Linux kernel subsystem for efficient data access monitoring and access-aware system operations.
With increasingly data-intensive workloads and limited DRAM capacity, optimal memory management based on dynamic access patterns is becoming increasingly important. Such mechanisms are only possible if accurate and efficient dynamic access pattern monitoring is available.
DAMON is a Linux kernel subsystem for such data access monitoring and access-aware system operations. It is designed with its key access monitroing mechanisms and a major feature called DAMOS, that make it</description>
