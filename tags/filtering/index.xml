      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re working on making DAMON to be used for page level properties based access monitoring. The idea is to let users describe specific page level properties that are interested in, and provides the size of the type of memory in each regions that DAMON found unique access pattern.
Hence, users can know how much of memory of specific access temperature is having the type. For example, you can know how much of memory that not accessed for more than 20 minutes are having how much file-backed pages of a cgroup.</description>

      <description>damo v2.5.7 is released on 2024-11-25. Two new major features on this version are temperature-based regions filtering and formatting.
Temperature &amp;ldquo;Temperature&amp;rdquo; of each memory region represents relative access hotness of the region. It is calculated as weighted sum of size, access rate (a.k.a nr_accesses) and age of each region. By default, the weights for the three properties are 0, 100, and 100. Users can manually set it using --temperature_weights option.</description>
