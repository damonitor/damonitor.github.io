      <description>This is also posted to DAMON mailing list.
Hello,
Last year around this time, I shared a humble retrospect of DAMON for 2022[1], which was effectively the first year it had after it was merged in the mainline. As one more year has passed, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share that again for the second year of DAMON, with some events and statistics of this year&amp;rsquo;s DAMON development that I was personally interested in.</description>

      <description>A summary of DAMON development in 2022 has posted: https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20221229171209.162356-1-sj@kernel.org/
2022 was a year of active and healthy DAMON development.
Seven new DAMON major features were delivered to users. Some of those were featured in articles and academic papers.
It was possible thanks to the DAMON community. The community has expanded with its own mailing list and an open bi-weekly chat series. 40 people contributed their great code to DAMON via making their 275 commits merged into the mainline.</description>
