      <description>From the very early days of DAMON, there were attempts to extend it for cpus-aware monitoring and write-only monitoring.
In 2022, Xin Hao proposed extending DAMON for NUMA access statistics.
In 2022 and 2025, Pedro Demarchi Gomes proposed extending DAMON for writes-only monitoring.
Those proposals are not yet upstreamed though. We continued similar DAMON extension discussions publicly and privately, with multiple parties, though.
I was recently taking some time on these, and happy to announce the first working prototype for the extensions.</description>
