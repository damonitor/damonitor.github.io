Detailed evaluation of DAMON and DAMON-based system optimizations are available at another post.\nDAMON is being used in real-world products including AWS Aurora Serverless and SK hynix HMSDK for proactive reclamation and CXL memory tiering. A number of academic researches are also utilizing DAMON for profiling and prototyping, as show by citations of the two (1, 2) DAMON intro papers.\nDAMON is available on Linux mainline since v5.15, and multiple major distros including Alma, Amazon, Android, Arch, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, open SUSE, Oracle.\nDemo Video Demo Screenshot Recent News Below are only a short list of recent news. For complete list of the news, please refer to a dedicated post.\n2025-11-13: An idea for DAMON-based CXL memory management aiming both bandwidth and capacity efficiency, which motivated by recent works from Micron and SK Hynix, has shared.\n2025-10-03: DAMON changes including below two have been merged into Linux 6.18-rc1, via memory management subsystem pull request.\nvirtual address space page level monitoring support, which was developed by Yueyang Pan (Meta). 32-bit ARM LAPE support, which was collaboratively developed by Meta and Huawei people (Quanmin Yan and Ze Zuo). 2025-09-23: DAMON has presented at Kernel Recipes.\n2025-08-22: A patch series for making DAMON supports ARM (32bit) with LPAE has just landed on mm-new tree. It was made by a great and joyful collaboration between I and Huawei (Quanmin Yan and Zuo Ze).\n2025-08-10: DAMON user-space tool added a visualization script for cold memory tail visualization.\nGetting Started You can start using DAMON by\ninstalling its user-space tool and following the tutorial of the user-space tool. Depending on your system and your desired use case, you might need to\ninstall DAMON-enabled and newer kernel, and/or run the automated tests suite. You can also participate in DAMON development.\nUser-space Tool A user-space tool for DAMON, which is called DAMO (Data Access Monitoring Operator), is available at Github and PyPi. You may start using DAMON by following the Getting Started of the tool for start.\nOfficial Document The official document of DAMON in the latest mainline for users/sysadmins and kernel programmers are available. Those for next major release are also available(users/sysadmins doc, kernel programmers doc).\nCommunity DAMON is maintained and developed by its own community, which is a sub-set of the linux kernel development community.\nThe community is mainly driven by the mailing list (damon@lists.linux.dev). All the patches are posted there and reviewed. Almost every discussions are also made there.\nFor easy communication, a mailing tool called HacKerMaiL is recommended. The tool is maintained by DAMON maintainer and committed to support DAMON community.\nIf you prefer web-based interface for reading the mails, you can use lore. If you prefer the traditional subscription based mailing workflow, you can subscribe to the mailing list via subspace.kernel.org following the instruction.\nThe community also have an open, regular, and informal virtual bi-weekly meeting series for DAMON community called DAMON Beer/Coffee/Tea chat series.\nContribution DAMON and its related projects including damo and hackermail are open source projects. You can contribute to the development following the guidelines. Please refer to below contribution guidelines of each project to further look into the process.\nDAMON damo hkml Setup for Advanced Use Cases Install DAMON is implemented in the Linux kernel, so you should install DAMON-enabled Linux kernel to use it.\nAs of 2025-11-25, kernels of major Linux distros including Alma Linux, Amazon Linux, Android, Arch, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE and Oracle Linux enabled DAMON. If you are using one of the kernels, you can skip this section. To check if you’re already running DAMON-enabled kernel, you could:\n$ if grep -q '^CONFIG_DAMON=y' /boot/config-$(uname -r); then echo \"installed\" else echo \"not installed\" fi If your package system doesn’t support DAMON-enabled kernel, you can fetch a DAMON-merged Linux kernel source tree, build, and install it. Note that you should enable kernel configuration options for DAMON, depending on your demands. For example:\n$ cd $THE_FETCHED_DAMON_KERNEL_SOURCE_TREE $ make olddefconfig $ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON=y' \u003e\u003e ./.config $ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_VADDR=y' \u003e\u003e ./.config $ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_PADDR=y' \u003e\u003e ./.config $ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_SYSFS=y' \u003e\u003e ./.config $ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_DBGFS=y' \u003e\u003e ./.config $ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_RECLAIM=y' \u003e\u003e ./.config $ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_LRU_SORT=y' \u003e\u003e ./.config $ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_STAT=y' \u003e\u003e ./.config $ make -j$(nproc) $ sudo make modules_install install Source Code There are several Linux kernel source trees having DAMON for different users. You may pick one among those based on your needs.\nFor users who want a stable version of DAMON, Linus Torvalds' mainline tree is recommended.\nIf you have interests in DAMON features under development, below trees will be appropriate. These trees contain latest version of DAMON which having features under development.\nmm-unstable contains the latest DAMON patches, which are under testing with other unstable memory management subsystem patches. So this tree is likely unstable and frequently updated, but would be a good baseline for your DAMON development. damon/next contains the latest changes, which might not tested at all. So this tree is likely more unstable and frequently updated than mm-unstable. This tree also contains some changes that exist only for DAMON hacks itself rather than eventually be merged in the mainline. For people who have interest in DAMON features under development but use LTS kernels as their baseline, three were trees that based on three latest LTS kernels.\nNOTE: Below trees were continuously getting DAMON backports on latest 5.4.y, 5.10.y, and 5.15.y. But those are deprecated as of 2022-09-03, and therefore there will be no update to the trees.\ndamon/for-v5.15.y damon/for-v5.10.y damon/for-v5.4.y The source code of DAPTRACE, which is a prototype of DAMON, is also available.\nTests Package There is a tests suite for correctness verification and performance evaluation of DAMON. Those are actively used for the development of DAMON. Using that, you can test DAMON on your machine with only a few simple commands or deeply understand the user interface of DAMON.\nSo, if you finished the tutorial but have no idea about what to do next, running the tests would be a good start. If any test fails, please report that to the maintainer via mail (sj@kernel.org or damon@lists.linux.dev) or github.\nShowcase Website There is a showcase website that you can get more information of DAMON. The site hosts\nthe heatmap format dynamic access pattern of various realistic workloads for heap area, mmap()-ed area, and stack area, the dynamic working set size distribution and chronological working set size changes, and daily performance test results. Goo to Read Evaluation Results Evaluation of DAMON and DAMON-based system optimizations are available.\nDAMON-based System Optimization Guide A guide for DAMON-based system optimizations are also available.\nProfile-Guided Optimization Example An example of DAMON-based profile-guided optimization is also available.\nPublications and Presentations Below are featured and/or upcoming publications and presentations covering DAMON. For more complete list of those, please refer to another dedicated post.\nAcademic papers For people who more familiar to academic papers, DAMON papers for Middleware'19 Industry and HPDC'22 are recommended to read and/or cite. The paper for Middleware'19 covers DAMON’s monitoring mechanisms and access pattern profiling-guided optimizations. The paper for HPDC'22 extends the coverage to DAMOS (automated access-aware system operations) and user-space driven auto-tuning.\nTalks for beginners and users If you are looking for a resources to start with, below talks are recommended.\nSeongJae Park, Overcoming Observer Effects in Memory Management with DAMON.

visualization.</p><h2 id=getting-started>Getting Started<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#getting-started>#</a></h2><p>You can start using DAMON by</p><ul><li>installing its <a href=#user-space-tool>user-space tool</a> and</li><li>following the <a href=https://github.com/damonitor/damo#getting-started>tutorial</a>
of the user-space tool.</li></ul><p>Depending on your system and your desired use case, you might need to</p><ul><li>install <a href=#install>DAMON-enabled and newer kernel</a>, and/or</li><li>run the automated <a href=#tests-package>tests suite</a>.</li></ul><p>You can also <a href=#contribution>participate</a> in DAMON development.</p><h2 id=user-space-tool>User-space Tool<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#user-space-tool>#</a></h2><p>A user-space tool for DAMON, which is called DAMO (Data Access Monitoring
Operator), is available at
<a href=https://github.com/damonitor/damo>Github</a> and
<a href=https://pypi.org/project/damo/>PyPi</a>. You may start using DAMON by following
the <a href=https://github.com/damonitor/damo#getting-started>Getting Started</a> of the
tool for start.</p><h2 id=official-document>Official Document<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#official-document>#</a></h2><p>The official document of DAMON in the latest mainline for
<a href=https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/damon/index.html>users/sysadmins</a> and
<a href=https://docs.kernel.org/mm/damon/index.html>kernel programmers</a> are
available. Those for next major release are also available(<a href=https://docs.kernel.org/next/admin-guide/mm/damon/index.html>users/sysadmins
doc</a>, <a href=https://docs.kernel.org/next/mm/damon/index.html>kernel
programmers doc</a>).</p><h2 id=community>Community<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#community>#</a></h2><p>DAMON is maintained and developed by its own community, which is a sub-set of
the linux kernel development community.</p><p>The community is mainly driven by the mailing list (<a href=mailto:damon@lists.linux.dev>damon@lists.linux.dev</a>).
All the patches are posted there and reviewed. Almost every discussions are
also made there.</p><p>For easy communication, a mailing tool called
<a href=https://github.com/sjp38/hackermail>HacKerMaiL</a> is recommended. The tool
is maintained by DAMON maintainer and committed to support DAMON community.</p><p>If you prefer web-based interface for reading the mails, you can use
<a href=https://lore.kernel.org/damon/>lore</a>. If you prefer the traditional
subscription based mailing workflow, you can subscribe to the mailing list via
<a href=https://subspace.kernel.org/lists.linux.dev.html>subspace.kernel.org</a>
following the <a href=https://subspace.kernel.org/#subscribing>instruction</a>.</p><p>The community also have an open, regular, and informal virtual bi-weekly
meeting series for DAMON community called DAMON Beer/Coffee/Tea chat
<a href=https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20220810225102.124459-1-sj@kernel.org/>series</a>.</p><h2 id=contribution>Contribution<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#contribution>#</a></h2><p>DAMON and its related projects including
<a href=https://github.com/damonitor/damo><code>damo</code></a> and
<a href=https://github.com/sjp38/hackermail><code>hackermail</code></a> are open source projects.
You can contribute to the development following the guidelines. Please refer
to below contribution guidelines of each project to further look into the
process.</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/mm/damon/maintainer-profile.html>DAMON</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/damonitor/damo/blob/next/CONTRIBUTING>damo</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/sjp38/hackermail/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING>hkml</a></li></ul><h2 id=setup-for-advanced-use-cases>Setup for Advanced Use Cases<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#setup-for-advanced-use-cases>#</a></h2><h3 id=install>Install<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#install>#</a></h3><p>DAMON is implemented in the Linux kernel, so you should install DAMON-enabled
Linux kernel to use it.</p><p>As of 2025-11-25, kernels of major Linux distros including Alma Linux, Amazon
Linux, Android, Arch, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, openSUSE and Oracle Linux
<a href="https://oracle.github.io/kconfigs/?config=UTS_RELEASE&amp;config=DAMON">enabled</a>
DAMON. If you are using one of the kernels, you can skip this section. To
check if you&rsquo;re already running DAMON-enabled kernel, you could:</p><pre><code>$ if grep -q '^CONFIG_DAMON=y' /boot/config-$(uname -r);
then
    echo &quot;installed&quot;
else
    echo &quot;not installed&quot;
fi
</code></pre><p>If your package system doesn&rsquo;t support DAMON-enabled kernel, you can
fetch a DAMON-merged Linux kernel <a href=#source-code>source tree</a>, build, and
install it. Note that you should enable kernel configuration options for
DAMON, depending on your demands. For example:</p><pre><code>$ cd $THE_FETCHED_DAMON_KERNEL_SOURCE_TREE
$ make olddefconfig
$ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON=y' &gt;&gt; ./.config
$ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_VADDR=y' &gt;&gt; ./.config
$ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_PADDR=y' &gt;&gt; ./.config
$ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_SYSFS=y' &gt;&gt; ./.config
$ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_DBGFS=y' &gt;&gt; ./.config
$ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_RECLAIM=y' &gt;&gt; ./.config
$ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_LRU_SORT=y' &gt;&gt; ./.config
$ echo 'CONFIG_DAMON_STAT=y' &gt;&gt; ./.config
$ make -j$(nproc)
$ sudo make modules_install install
</code></pre><h3 id=source-code>Source Code<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#source-code>#</a></h3><p>There are several Linux kernel source trees having DAMON for different users.
You may pick one among those based on your needs.</p><p>For users who want a <strong>stable</strong> version of DAMON, Linus Torvalds'
<a href=https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/h/master>mainline tree</a> is recommended.</p><p>If you have interests in DAMON features under <strong>development</strong>, below trees will
be appropriate. These trees contain latest version of DAMON which having
features under development.</p><ul><li><a href=https://git.kernel.org/akpm/mm/h/mm-unstable>mm-unstable</a> contains the
latest DAMON patches, which are under testing with other unstable memory
management subsystem patches. So this tree is likely unstable and frequently
updated, but would be a good baseline for your DAMON development.</li><li><a href=https://git.kernel.org/sj/h/damon/next>damon/next</a> contains the latest
changes, which might not tested at all. So this tree is likely more unstable
and frequently updated than mm-unstable. This tree also contains some
changes that exist only for DAMON hacks itself rather than eventually be
merged in the mainline.</li></ul><p>For people who have interest in DAMON features under development but use LTS
kernels as their baseline, three <em>were</em> trees that based on three latest LTS
kernels.</p><p>NOTE: Below trees were continuously getting DAMON backports on latest 5.4.y,
5.10.y, and 5.15.y. But those are deprecated as of 2022-09-03, and therefore
there will be no update to the trees.</p><ul><li><a href=https://git.kernel.org/sj/h/damon/for-v5.15.y>damon/for-v5.15.y</a></li><li><a href=https://git.kernel.org/sj/h/damon/for-v5.10.y>damon/for-v5.10.y</a></li><li><a href=https://git.kernel.org/sj/h/damon/for-v5.4.y>damon/for-v5.4.y</a></li></ul><p>The source code of DAPTRACE, which is a prototype of DAMON, is also
<a href=https://github.com/daptrace>available</a>.</p><h3 id=tests-package>Tests Package<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tests-package>#</a></h3><p>There is a <a href=https://github.com/damonitor/damon-tests>tests suite</a> for
correctness verification and performance evaluation of DAMON. Those are
actively used for the development of DAMON. Using that, you can test DAMON on
your machine with only a few simple commands or deeply understand the user
interface of DAMON.</p><p>So, if you finished the
<a href=https://github.com/damonitor/damo#getting-started>tutorial</a> but have no idea
about what to do next, running the tests would be a good start. If any test
fails, please report that to the maintainer via mail (<a href=mailto:sj@kernel.org>sj@kernel.org</a> or
<a href=mailto:damon@lists.linux.dev>damon@lists.linux.dev</a>) or
