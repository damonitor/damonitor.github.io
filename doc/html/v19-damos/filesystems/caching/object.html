<h1>In-Kernel Cache Object Representation and Management<a class="headerlink" href="#in-kernel-cache-object-representation-and-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>By: David Howells &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:dhowells&#37;&#52;&#48;redhat&#46;com">dhowells<span>&#64;</span>redhat<span>&#46;</span>com</a>&gt;</p>
<div class="section" id="representation">
<h2>Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#representation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>FS-Cache maintains an in-kernel representation of each object that a netfs is
currently interested in.  Such objects are represented by the fscache_cookie
struct and are referred to as cookies.</p>
<p>FS-Cache also maintains a separate in-kernel representation of the objects that
a cache backend is currently actively caching.  Such objects are represented by
the fscache_object struct.  The cache backends allocate these upon request, and
are expected to embed them in their own representations.  These are referred to
as objects.</p>
<p>There is a 1:N relationship between cookies and objects.  A cookie may be
represented by multiple objects - an index may exist in more than one cache -
or even by no objects (it may not be cached).</p>
<p>Furthermore, both cookies and objects are hierarchical.  The two hierarchies
correspond, but the cookies tree is a superset of the union of the object trees
of multiple caches:</p>

</div>
<p>In the above illustration, ICookie and IObject represent indices and DCookie
and DObject represent data storage objects.  Indices may have representation in
multiple caches, but currently, non-index objects may not.  Objects of any type
may also be entirely unrepresented.</p>
<p>As far as the netfs API goes, the netfs is only actually permitted to see
pointers to the cookies.  The cookies themselves and any objects attached to
those cookies are hidden from it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="object-management-state-machine">
<h2>Object Management State Machine<a class="headerlink" href="#object-management-state-machine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Within FS-Cache, each active object is managed by its own individual state
machine.  The state for an object is kept in the fscache_object struct, in
object-&gt;state.  A cookie may point to a set of objects that are in different
states.</p>
<p>Each state has an action associated with it that is invoked when the machine
wakes up in that state.  There are four logical sets of states:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Preparation: states that wait for the parent objects to become ready.  The
representations are hierarchical, and it is expected that an object must
be created or accessed with respect to its parent object.</li>
<li>Initialisation: states that perform lookups in the cache and validate
what’s found and that create on disk any missing metadata.</li>
<li>Normal running: states that allow netfs operations on objects to proceed
and that update the state of objects.</li>
<li>Termination: states that detach objects from their netfs cookies, that
delete objects from disk, that handle disk and system errors and that free
up in-memory resources.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In most cases, transitioning between states is in response to signalled events.
When a state has finished processing, it will usually set the mask of events in
which it is interested (object-&gt;event_mask) and relinquish the worker thread.
Then when an event is raised (by calling fscache_raise_event()), if the event
is not masked, the object will be queued for processing (by calling
fscache_enqueue_object()).</p>
<div class="section" id="provision-of-cpu-time">
<h3>Provision of CPU Time<a class="headerlink" href="#provision-of-cpu-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The work to be done by the various states was given CPU time by the threads of
the slow work facility.  This was used in preference to the workqueue facility
because:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Threads may be completely occupied for very long periods of time by a
particular work item.  These state actions may be doing sequences of
synchronous, journalled disk accesses (lookup, mkdir, create, setxattr,
getxattr, truncate, unlink, rmdir, rename).</li>
<li>Threads may do little actual work, but may rather spend a lot of time
sleeping on I/O.  This means that single-threaded and 1-per-CPU-threaded
workqueues don’t necessarily have the right numbers of threads.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="locking-simplification">
<h3>Locking Simplification<a class="headerlink" href="#locking-simplification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Because only one worker thread may be operating on any particular object’s
state machine at once, this simplifies the locking, particularly with respect
to disconnecting the netfs’s representation of a cache object (fscache_cookie)
from the cache backend’s representation (fscache_object) - which may be
requested from either end.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-set-of-states">
<h2>The Set of States<a class="headerlink" href="#the-set-of-states" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The object state machine has a set of states that it can be in.  There are
preparation states in which the object sets itself up and waits for its parent
object to transit to a state that allows access to its children:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_INIT.</p>
<p>Initialise the object and wait for the parent object to become active.  In
the cache, it is expected that it will not be possible to look an object
up from the parent object, until that parent object itself has been looked
up.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are initialisation states in which the object sets itself up and accesses
disk for the object metadata:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_LOOKING_UP.</p>
<p>Look up the object on disk, using the parent as a starting point.
FS-Cache expects the cache backend to probe the cache to see whether this
object is represented there, and if it is, to see if it’s valid (coherency
management).</p>
<p>The cache should call fscache_object_lookup_negative() to indicate lookup
failure for whatever reason, and should call fscache_obtained_object() to
indicate success.</p>
<p>At the completion of lookup, FS-Cache will let the netfs go ahead with
read operations, no matter whether the file is yet cached.  If not yet
cached, read operations will be immediately rejected with ENODATA until
the first known page is uncached - as to that point there can be no data
to be read out of the cache for that file that isn’t currently also held
in the pagecache.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_CREATING.</p>
<p>Create an object on disk, using the parent as a starting point.  This
happens if the lookup failed to find the object, or if the object’s
coherency data indicated what’s on disk is out of date.  In this state,
FS-Cache expects the cache to create</p>
<p>The cache should call fscache_obtained_object() if creation completes
successfully, fscache_object_lookup_negative() otherwise.</p>
<p>At the completion of creation, FS-Cache will start processing write
operations the netfs has queued for an object.  If creation failed, the
write ops will be transparently discarded, and nothing recorded in the
cache.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are some normal running states in which the object spends its time
servicing netfs requests:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic" start="4">
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>A transient state in which pending operations are started, child objects
are permitted to advance from FSCACHE_OBJECT_INIT state, and temporary
lookup data is freed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_ACTIVE.</p>
<p>The normal running state.  In this state, requests the netfs makes will be
passed on to the cache.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_INVALIDATING.</p>
<p>The object is undergoing invalidation.  When the state comes here, it
discards all pending read, write and attribute change operations as it is
going to clear out the cache entirely and reinitialise it.  It will then
continue to the FSCACHE_OBJECT_UPDATING state.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_UPDATING.</p>
<p>The state machine comes here to update the object in the cache from the
netfs’s records.  This involves updating the auxiliary data that is used
to maintain coherency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>And there are terminal states in which an object cleans itself up, deallocates
memory and potentially deletes stuff from disk:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic" start="8">
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_LC_DYING.</p>
<p>The object comes here if it is dying because of a lookup or creation
error.  This would be due to a disk error or system error of some sort.
Temporary data is cleaned up, and the parent is released.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_DYING.</p>
<p>The object comes here if it is dying due to an error, because its parent
cookie has been relinquished by the netfs or because the cache is being
withdrawn.</p>
<p>Any child objects waiting on this one are given CPU time so that they too
can destroy themselves.  This object waits for all its children to go away
before advancing to the next state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic" start="10">
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_ABORT_INIT.</p>
<p>The object comes to this state if it was waiting on its parent in
FSCACHE_OBJECT_INIT, but its parent died.  The object will destroy itself
so that the parent may proceed from the FSCACHE_OBJECT_DYING state.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_RELEASING.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_RECYCLING.</p>
<p>The object comes to one of these two states when dying once it is rid of
all its children, if it is dying because the netfs relinquished its
cookie.  In the first state, the cached data is expected to persist, and
in the second it will be deleted.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_WITHDRAWING.</p>
<p>The object transits to this state if the cache decides it wants to
withdraw the object from service, perhaps to make space, but also due to
error or just because the whole cache is being withdrawn.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">State FSCACHE_OBJECT_DEAD.</p>
<p>The object transits to this state when the in-memory object record is
ready to be deleted.  The object processor shouldn’t ever see an object in
this state.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="the-set-of-events">
<h3>The Set of Events<a class="headerlink" href="#the-set-of-events" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are a number of events that can be raised to an object state machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>FSCACHE_OBJECT_EV_UPDATE</dt>
<dd>The netfs requested that an object be updated.  The state machine will ask
the cache backend to update the object, and the cache backend will ask the
netfs for details of the change through its cookie definition ops.</dd>
<dt>FSCACHE_OBJECT_EV_CLEARED</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This is signalled in two circumstances:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>when an object’s last child object is dropped and</li>
<li>when the last operation outstanding on an object is completed.</li>
</ol>
<p class="last">This is used to proceed from the dying state.</p>
</dd>
<dt>FSCACHE_OBJECT_EV_ERROR</dt>
<dd>This is signalled when an I/O error occurs during the processing of some
object.</dd>
<dt>FSCACHE_OBJECT_EV_RELEASE, FSCACHE_OBJECT_EV_RETIRE</dt>
<dd>These are signalled when the netfs relinquishes a cookie it was using.
The event selected depends on whether the netfs asks for the backing
object to be retired (deleted) or retained.</dd>
<dt>FSCACHE_OBJECT_EV_WITHDRAW</dt>
<dd>This is signalled when the cache backend wants to withdraw an object.
This means that the object will have to be detached from the netfs’s
cookie.</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Because the withdrawing releasing/retiring events are all handled by the object
state machine, it doesn’t matter if there’s a collision with both ends trying
to sever the connection at the same time.  The state machine can just pick
which one it wants to honour, and that effects the other.</p>
