<h1>Scheduler Statistics<a class="headerlink" href="#scheduler-statistics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Version 15 of schedstats dropped counters for some sched_yield:
yld_exp_empty, yld_act_empty and yld_both_empty. Otherwise, it is
identical to version 14.</p>
<p>Version 14 of schedstats includes support for sched_domains, which hit the
mainline kernel in 2.6.20 although it is identical to the stats from version
12 which was in the kernel from 2.6.13-2.6.19 (version 13 never saw a kernel
release).  Some counters make more sense to be per-runqueue; other to be
per-domain.  Note that domains (and their associated information) will only
be pertinent and available on machines utilizing CONFIG_SMP.</p>
<p>In version 14 of schedstat, there is at least one level of domain
statistics for each cpu listed, and there may well be more than one
domain.  Domains have no particular names in this implementation, but
the highest numbered one typically arbitrates balancing across all the
cpus on the machine, while domain0 is the most tightly focused domain,
sometimes balancing only between pairs of cpus.  At this time, there
are no architectures which need more than three domain levels. The first
field in the domain stats is a bit map indicating which cpus are affected
by that domain.</p>
<p>These fields are counters, and only increment.  Programs which make use
of these will need to start with a baseline observation and then calculate
the change in the counters at each subsequent observation.  A perl script
which does this for many of the fields is available at</p>
<blockquote>
<div><a class="reference external" href="http://eaglet.pdxhosts.com/rick/linux/schedstat/">http://eaglet.pdxhosts.com/rick/linux/schedstat/</a></div></blockquote>
<p>Note that any such script will necessarily be version-specific, as the main
reason to change versions is changes in the output format.  For those wishing
to write their own scripts, the fields are described here.</p>

<p>cpu&lt;N&gt; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p>
<p>First field is a sched_yield() statistic:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li># of times sched_yield() was called</li>

</div></blockquote>
<p>Next three are schedule() statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>This field is a legacy array expiration count field used in the O(1)
scheduler. We kept it for ABI compatibility, but it is always set to zero.</li>
<li># of times schedule() was called</li>
<li># of times schedule() left the processor idle</li>
</ol>

<p>Next two are try_to_wake_up() statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li># of times try_to_wake_up() was called</li>
<li># of times try_to_wake_up() was called to wake up the local cpu</li>

<p>Next three are statistics describing scheduling latency:</p>

will not appear in the output.)</p>

<p>The first field is a bit mask indicating what cpus this domain operates over.</p>
<p>The next 24 are a variety of load_balance() statistics in grouped into types
of idleness (idle, busy, and newly idle):</p>
<blockquote>

</div></blockquote>
<p>Next three are active_load_balance() statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="25">
<li># of times active_load_balance() was called</li>
<li># of times active_load_balance() tried to move a task and failed</li>

<p>Next three are sched_balance_exec() statistics:</p>

<li>sbe_cnt is not used</li>
<li>sbe_balanced is not used</li>
<li>sbe_pushed is not used</li>

<li>sbf_cnt is not used</li>
<li>sbf_balanced is not used</li>
<li>sbf_pushed is not used</li>

<p>Next three are try_to_wake_up() statistics:</p>

<div><ol class="arabic simple" start="34">
<li># of times in this domain try_to_wake_up() awoke a task that
last ran on a different cpu in this domain</li>

<h2>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/schedstat<a class="headerlink" href="#proc-pid-schedstat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>schedstats also adds a new /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/schedstat file to include some of
the same information on a per-process level.  There are three fields in
this file correlating for that process to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>time spent on the cpu</li>
<li>time spent waiting on a runqueue</li>
<li># of timeslices run on this cpu</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A program could be easily written to make use of these extra fields to
report on how well a particular process or set of processes is faring
under the scheduler’s policies.  A simple version of such a program is
available at</p>
