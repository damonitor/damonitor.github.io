<p>This document describes the format and semantics of the statistics
which the kernel NFS server makes available to userspace.  These
statistics are available in several text form pseudo files, each of
which is described separately below.</p>
<p>In most cases you don’t need to know these formats, as the nfsstat(8)
program from the nfs-utils distribution provides a helpful command-line
interface for extracting and printing them.</p>
<p>All the files described here are formatted as a sequence of text lines,
separated by newline ‘n’ characters.  Lines beginning with a hash
‘#’ character are comments intended for humans and should be ignored
by parsing routines.  All other lines contain a sequence of fields
separated by whitespace.</p>
<div class="section" id="proc-fs-nfsd-pool-stats">
<h2>/proc/fs/nfsd/pool_stats<a class="headerlink" href="#proc-fs-nfsd-pool-stats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This file is available in kernels from 2.6.30 onwards, if the
/proc/fs/nfsd filesystem is mounted (it almost always should be).</p>
<p>The first line is a comment which describes the fields present in
all the other lines.  The other lines present the following data as
a sequence of unsigned decimal numeric fields.  One line is shown
for each NFS thread pool.</p>
<p>All counters are 64 bits wide and wrap naturally.  There is no way
to zero these counters, instead applications should do their own
rate conversion.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>pool</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The id number of the NFS thread pool to which this line applies.
This number does not change.</p>
<p class="last">Thread pool ids are a contiguous set of small integers starting
at zero.  The maximum value depends on the thread pool mode, but
currently cannot be larger than the number of CPUs in the system.
Note that in the default case there will be a single thread pool
which contains all the nfsd threads and all the CPUs in the system,
and thus this file will have a single line with a pool id of “0”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>packets-arrived</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Counts how many NFS packets have arrived.  More precisely, this
is the number of times that the network stack has notified the
sunrpc server layer that new data may be available on a transport
(e.g. an NFS or UDP socket or an NFS/RDMA endpoint).</p>
<p class="last">Depending on the NFS workload patterns and various network stack
effects (such as Large Receive Offload) which can combine packets
on the wire, this may be either more or less than the number
of NFS calls received (which statistic is available elsewhere).
However this is a more accurate and less workload-dependent measure
of how much CPU load is being placed on the sunrpc server layer
due to NFS network traffic.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sockets-enqueued</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Counts how many times an NFS transport is enqueued to wait for
an nfsd thread to service it, i.e. no nfsd thread was considered
available.</p>
<p>The circumstance this statistic tracks indicates that there was NFS
network-facing work to be done but it couldn’t be done immediately,
thus introducing a small delay in servicing NFS calls.  The ideal
rate of change for this counter is zero; significantly non-zero
values may indicate a performance limitation.</p>
<p class="last">This can happen because there are too few nfsd threads in the thread
pool for the NFS workload (the workload is thread-limited), in which
case configuring more nfsd threads will probably improve the
performance of the NFS workload.</p>
</dd>
<dt>threads-woken</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Counts how many times an idle nfsd thread is woken to try to
receive some data from an NFS transport.</p>
<p class="last">This statistic tracks the circumstance where incoming
network-facing NFS work is being handled quickly, which is a good
thing.  The ideal rate of change for this counter will be close
to but less than the rate of change of the packets-arrived counter.</p>
</dd>
<dt>threads-timedout</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Counts how many times an nfsd thread triggered an idle timeout,
i.e. was not woken to handle any incoming network packets for
some time.</p>
<p>This statistic counts a circumstance where there are more nfsd
threads configured than can be used by the NFS workload.  This is
a clue that the number of nfsd threads can be reduced without
affecting performance.  Unfortunately, it’s only a clue and not
a strong indication, for a couple of reasons:</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Currently the rate at which the counter is incremented is quite
slow; the idle timeout is 60 minutes.  Unless the NFS workload
remains constant for hours at a time, this counter is unlikely
to be providing information that is still useful.</li>
<li>It is usually a wise policy to provide some slack,
i.e. configure a few more nfsds than are currently needed,
to allow for future spikes in load.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that incoming packets on NFS transports will be dealt with in
one of three ways.  An nfsd thread can be woken (threads-woken counts
this case), or the transport can be enqueued for later attention
(sockets-enqueued counts this case), or the packet can be temporarily
deferred because the transport is currently being used by an nfsd
thread.  This last case is not very interesting and is not explicitly
counted, but can be inferred from the other counters thus:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>packets-deferred = packets-arrived - ( sockets-enqueued + threads-woken )
</pre></div>
