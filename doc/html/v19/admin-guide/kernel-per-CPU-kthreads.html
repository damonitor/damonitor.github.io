<h1>Reducing OS jitter due to per-cpu kthreads<a class="headerlink" href="#reducing-os-jitter-due-to-per-cpu-kthreads" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This document lists per-CPU kthreads in the Linux kernel and presents
options to control their OS jitter.  Note that non-per-CPU kthreads are
not listed here.  To reduce OS jitter from non-per-CPU kthreads, bind
them to a “housekeeping” CPU dedicated to such work.</p>

<li><p class="first">Run your workload at a real-time priority, which will allow
preempting the kworker daemons.</p>

Such a workqueue can be confined to a given subset of the
CPUs using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/sys/devices/virtual/workqueue/*/cpumask</span></code> sysfs

“ls /sys/devices/virtual/workqueue”.  That said, the workqueues
maintainer would like to caution people against indiscriminately
sprinkling WQ_SYSFS across all the workqueues.  The reason for
caution is that it is easy to add WQ_SYSFS, but because sysfs is
part of the formal user/kernel API, it can be nearly impossible
to remove it, even if its addition was a mistake.</p>

<li><p class="first">Build your kernel with CONFIG_SLUB=y rather than
CONFIG_SLAB=y, thus avoiding the slab allocator’s periodic
use of each CPU’s workqueues to run its cache_reap()
function.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Avoid using oprofile, thus avoiding OS jitter from
wq_sync_buffer().</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Limit your CPU frequency so that a CPU-frequency
governor is not required, possibly enlisting the aid of
special heatsinks or other cooling technologies.  If done
correctly, and if you CPU architecture permits, you should
be able to build your kernel with CONFIG_CPU_FREQ=n to
avoid the CPU-frequency governor periodically running
on each CPU, including cs_dbs_timer() and od_dbs_timer().</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">As of v3.18, Christoph Lameter’s on-demand vmstat workers
commit prevents OS jitter due to vmstat_update() on
CONFIG_SMP=y systems.  Before v3.18, is not possible
to entirely get rid of the OS jitter, but you can
decrease its frequency by writing a large value to
/proc/sys/vm/stat_interval.  The default value is HZ,
for an interval of one second.  Of course, larger values
will make your virtual-memory statistics update more
slowly.  Of course, you can also run your workload at
a real-time priority, thus preempting vmstat_update(),
but if your workload is CPU-bound, this is a bad idea.
However, there is an RFC patch from Christoph Lameter
(based on an earlier one from Gilad Ben-Yossef) that
reduces or even eliminates vmstat overhead for some
workloads at <a class="reference external" href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/4/379">https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/9/4/379</a>.</p>

<li><p class="first">If running on high-end powerpc servers, build with
CONFIG_PPC_RTAS_DAEMON=n.  This prevents the RTAS
daemon from running on each CPU every second or so.

this platform’s RAS functionality.)  This avoids jitter
due to the rtas_event_scan() function.
