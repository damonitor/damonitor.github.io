<h1>Altera Triple-Speed Ethernet MAC driver<a class="headerlink" href="#altera-triple-speed-ethernet-mac-driver" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Copyright © 2008-2014 Altera Corporation</p>
<p>This is the driver for the Altera Triple-Speed Ethernet (TSE) controllers
using the SGDMA and MSGDMA soft DMA IP components. The driver uses the
platform bus to obtain component resources. The designs used to test this
driver were built for a Cyclone(R) V SOC FPGA board, a Cyclone(R) V FPGA board,
and tested with ARM and NIOS processor hosts separately. The anticipated use
cases are simple communications between an embedded system and an external peer
for status and simple configuration of the embedded system.</p>
<p>For more information visit www.altera.com and www.rocketboards.org. Support
forums for the driver may be found on www.rocketboards.org, and a design used
to test this driver may be found there as well. Support is also available from
the maintainer of this driver, found in MAINTAINERS.</p>
<p>The Triple-Speed Ethernet, SGDMA, and MSGDMA components are all soft IP
components that can be assembled and built into an FPGA using the Altera
Quartus toolchain. Quartus 13.1 and 14.0 were used to build the design that
this driver was tested against. The sopc2dts tool is used to create the
device tree for the driver, and may be found at rocketboards.org.</p>
<p>The driver probe function examines the device tree and determines if the
Triple-Speed Ethernet instance is using an SGDMA or MSGDMA component. The
probe function then installs the appropriate set of DMA routines to
initialize, setup transmits, receives, and interrupt handling primitives for
the respective configurations.</p>
<p>The SGDMA component is to be deprecated in the near future (over the next 1-2
years as of this writing in early 2014) in favor of the MSGDMA component.
SGDMA support is included for existing designs and reference in case a
developer wishes to support their own soft DMA logic and driver support. Any
new designs should not use the SGDMA.</p>
<p>The SGDMA supports only a single transmit or receive operation at a time, and
therefore will not perform as well compared to the MSGDMA soft IP. Please
visit www.altera.com for known, documented SGDMA errata.</p>
<p>Scatter-gather DMA is not supported by the SGDMA or MSGDMA at this time.
Scatter-gather DMA will be added to a future maintenance update to this
driver.</p>
<p>Jumbo frames are not supported at this time.</p>
<p>The driver limits PHY operations to 10/100Mbps, and has not yet been fully
tested for 1Gbps. This support will be added in a future maintenance update.</p>

<div class="section" id="transmit-process">
<h3>4.1. Transmit process<a class="headerlink" href="#transmit-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the driver’s transmit routine is called by the kernel, it sets up a
transmit descriptor by calling the underlying DMA transmit routine (SGDMA or
MSGDMA), and initiates a transmit operation. Once the transmit is complete, an
interrupt is driven by the transmit DMA logic. The driver handles the transmit
completion in the context of the interrupt handling chain by recycling
resource required to send and track the requested transmit operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="receive-process">
<h3>4.2. Receive process<a class="headerlink" href="#receive-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The driver will post receive buffers to the receive DMA logic during driver
initialization. Receive buffers may or may not be queued depending upon the
underlying DMA logic (MSGDMA is able queue receive buffers, SGDMA is not able
to queue receive buffers to the SGDMA receive logic). When a packet is
received, the DMA logic generates an interrupt. The driver handles a receive
interrupt by obtaining the DMA receive logic status, reaping receive
completions until no more receive completions are available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interrupt-mitigation">
<h3>4.3. Interrupt Mitigation<a class="headerlink" href="#interrupt-mitigation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The driver is able to mitigate the number of its DMA interrupts
using NAPI for receive operations. Interrupt mitigation is not yet supported
for transmit operations, but will be added in a future maintenance release.</p>

transmitted.</p>
<p>“rx_packets” is equivalent to aFramesReceivedOK defined in IEEE 802.3-2012,

802.3-2012, Section 5.2.2.1.6. This statistic is the count of frames that are

is received.</p>
<p>“rx_align_errors” is equivalent to aAlignmentErrors defined in IEEE 802.3-2012,
Section 5.2.2.1.7. This statistic is the count of frames that are not an

received.</p>
<p>“tx_bytes” is equivalent to aOctetsTransmittedOK defined in IEEE 802.3-2012,

a count of the number of packets received containing errors that prevented the
packet from being delivered to a higher level protocol.</p>
