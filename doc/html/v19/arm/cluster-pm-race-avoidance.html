<h1>Cluster-wide Power-up/power-down race avoidance algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#cluster-wide-power-up-power-down-race-avoidance-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This file documents the algorithm which is used to coordinate CPU and
cluster setup and teardown operations and to manage hardware coherency
controls safely.</p>
<p>The section “Rationale” explains what the algorithm is for and why it is
needed.  “Basic model” explains general concepts using a simplified view
of the system.  The other sections explain the actual details of the
algorithm in use.</p>
<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h2>Rationale<a class="headerlink" href="#rationale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a system containing multiple CPUs, it is desirable to have the
ability to turn off individual CPUs when the system is idle, reducing
power consumption and thermal dissipation.</p>
<p>In a system containing multiple clusters of CPUs, it is also desirable
to have the ability to turn off entire clusters.</p>
<p>Turning entire clusters off and on is a risky business, because it
involves performing potentially destructive operations affecting a group
of independently running CPUs, while the OS continues to run.  This
means that we need some coordination in order to ensure that critical
cluster-level operations are only performed when it is truly safe to do
so.</p>
<p>Simple locking may not be sufficient to solve this problem, because
mechanisms like Linux spinlocks may rely on coherency mechanisms which
are not immediately enabled when a cluster powers up.  Since enabling or
disabling those mechanisms may itself be a non-atomic operation (such as
writing some hardware registers and invalidating large caches), other
methods of coordination are required in order to guarantee safe
power-down and power-up at the cluster level.</p>
<p>The mechanism presented in this document describes a coherent memory
based protocol for performing the needed coordination.  It aims to be as
lightweight as possible, while providing the required safety properties.</p>

<p>Each CPU has one of these states assigned to it at any point in time.

<p>Each cluster is also assigned a state, but it is necessary to split the

to introduce additional states in order to avoid races between different
CPUs in the cluster simultaneously modifying the state.  The cluster-
level states are described in the “Cluster state” section.</p>
<p>To help distinguish the CPU states from cluster states in this
discussion, the state names are given a <cite>CPU_</cite> prefix for the CPU states,
and a <cite>CLUSTER_</cite> or <cite>INBOUND_</cite> prefix for the cluster states.</p>

<h2>Cluster state<a class="headerlink" href="#cluster-state" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A cluster is a group of connected CPUs with some common resources.
Because a cluster contains multiple CPUs, it can be doing multiple
things at the same time.  This has some implications.  In particular, a
CPU can start up while another CPU is tearing the cluster down.</p>
<p>In this discussion, the “outbound side” is the view of the cluster state
as seen by a CPU tearing the cluster down.  The “inbound side” is the
view of the cluster state as seen by a CPU setting the CPU up.</p>
<p>In order to enable safe coordination in such situations, it is important
that a CPU which is setting up the cluster can advertise its state
independently of the CPU which is tearing down the cluster.  For this
reason, the cluster state is split into two parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“cluster” state: The global state of the cluster; or the state
on the outbound side:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>CLUSTER_DOWN</li>
<li>CLUSTER_UP</li>
<li>CLUSTER_GOING_DOWN</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>“inbound” state: The state of the cluster on the inbound side.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>INBOUND_NOT_COMING_UP</li>
<li>INBOUND_COMING_UP</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The different pairings of these states results in six possible
states for the cluster as a whole:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                          CLUSTER_UP

                     INBOUND_NOT_COMING_UP
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Transitions —–&gt; can only be made by the outbound CPU, and
only involve changes to the “cluster” state.</p>
<p>Transitions ===##&gt; can only be made by the inbound CPU, and only
involve changes to the “inbound” state, except where there is no
further transition possible on the outbound side (i.e., the
outbound CPU has put the cluster into the CLUSTER_DOWN state).</p>
<p>The race avoidance algorithm does not provide a way to determine
which exact CPUs within the cluster play these roles.  This must
be decided in advance by some other means.  Refer to the section
“Last man and first man selection” for more explanation.</p>
<p>CLUSTER_DOWN/INBOUND_NOT_COMING_UP is the only state where the
cluster can actually be powered down.</p>
<p>The parallelism of the inbound and outbound CPUs is observed by
the existence of two different paths from CLUSTER_GOING_DOWN/
INBOUND_NOT_COMING_UP (corresponding to GOING_DOWN in the basic
model) to CLUSTER_DOWN/INBOUND_COMING_UP (corresponding to
COMING_UP in the basic model).  The second path avoids cluster
teardown completely.</p>
<p>CLUSTER_UP/INBOUND_COMING_UP is equivalent to UP in the basic
model.  The final transition to CLUSTER_UP/INBOUND_NOT_COMING_UP
is trivial and merely resets the state machine ready for the
next cycle.</p>
<p>Details of the allowable transitions follow.</p>
<p>The next state in each case is notated</p>
<blockquote>
<div>&lt;cluster state&gt;/&lt;inbound state&gt; (&lt;transitioner&gt;)</div></blockquote>
<p>where the &lt;transitioner&gt; is the side on which the transition
can occur; either the inbound or the outbound side.</p>

<h2>Last man and First man selection<a class="headerlink" href="#last-man-and-first-man-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CPU which performs cluster tear-down operations on the outbound side
is commonly referred to as the “last man”.</p>
<p>The CPU which performs cluster setup on the inbound side is commonly
referred to as the “first man”.</p>
<p>The race avoidance algorithm documented above does not provide a
mechanism to choose which CPUs should play these roles.</p>
<p>Last man:</p>
<p>When shutting down the cluster, all the CPUs involved are initially
executing Linux and hence coherent.  Therefore, ordinary spinlocks can
be used to select a last man safely, before the CPUs become
non-coherent.</p>
<p>First man:</p>
<p>Because CPUs may power up asynchronously in response to external wake-up
events, a dynamic mechanism is needed to make sure that only one CPU
attempts to play the first man role and do the cluster-level
initialisation: any other CPUs must wait for this to complete before
proceeding.</p>
<p>Cluster-level initialisation may involve actions such as configuring
coherency controls in the bus fabric.</p>
<p>The current implementation in mcpm_head.S uses a separate mutual exclusion
mechanism to do this arbitration.  This mechanism is documented in
detail in vlocks.txt.</p>

arch/arm/common/mcpm_head.S (low-level inbound CPU operations) and
arch/arm/common/mcpm_entry.c (everything else):</p>
<p>__mcpm_cpu_going_down() signals the transition of a CPU to the
CPU_GOING_DOWN state.</p>
<p>__mcpm_cpu_down() signals the transition of a CPU to the CPU_DOWN
state.</p>
<p>A CPU transitions to CPU_COMING_UP and then to CPU_UP via the
low-level power-up code in mcpm_head.S.  This could
involve CPU-specific setup code, but in the current
implementation it does not.</p>
<p>__mcpm_outbound_enter_critical() and __mcpm_outbound_leave_critical()
handle transitions from CLUSTER_UP to CLUSTER_GOING_DOWN
and from there to CLUSTER_DOWN or back to CLUSTER_UP (in
the case of an aborted cluster power-down).</p>
<p>These functions are more complex than the __mcpm_cpu_*()
functions due to the extra inter-CPU coordination which
is needed for safe transitions at the cluster level.</p>
<p>A cluster transitions from CLUSTER_DOWN back to CLUSTER_UP via
the low-level power-up code in mcpm_head.S.  This
typically involves platform-specific setup code,
provided by the platform-specific power_up_setup
function registered via mcpm_sync_init.</p>

<p>Deep topologies:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>As currently described and implemented, the algorithm does not
support CPU topologies involving more than two levels (i.e.,
clusters of clusters are not supported).  The algorithm could be
extended by replicating the cluster-level states for the
additional topological levels, and modifying the transition
rules for the intermediate (non-outermost) cluster levels.</div></blockquote>
