<p>KVM makes use of some custom MSRs to service some requests.</p>
<p>Custom MSRs have a range reserved for them, that goes from
0x4b564d00 to 0x4b564dff. There are MSRs outside this area,
but they are deprecated and their use is discouraged.</p>

<dd><p class="first">Asynchronous page fault (APF) control MSR.</p>
<p>Bits 63-6 hold 64-byte aligned physical address of a 64 byte memory area
which must be in guest RAM and must be zeroed. This memory is expected
to hold a copy of the following structure:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>struct kvm_vcpu_pv_apf_data {
      /* Used for &#39;page not present&#39; events delivered via #PF */

      __u32 token;

      __u8 pad[56];
      __u32 enabled;
};
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Bits 5-4 of the MSR are reserved and should be zero. Bit 0 is set to 1
when asynchronous page faults are enabled on the vcpu, 0 when disabled.
Bit 1 is 1 if asynchronous page faults can be injected when vcpu is in
cpl == 0. Bit 2 is 1 if asynchronous page faults are delivered to L1 as
#PF vmexits.  Bit 2 can be set only if KVM_FEATURE_ASYNC_PF_VMEXIT is
present in CPUID. Bit 3 enables interrupt based delivery of ‘page ready’
events. Bit 3 can only be set if KVM_FEATURE_ASYNC_PF_INT is present in
CPUID.</p>
<p>‘Page not present’ events are currently always delivered as synthetic
#PF exception. During delivery of these events APF CR2 register contains
a token that will be used to notify the guest when missing page becomes
available. Also, to make it possible to distinguish between real #PF and
APF, first 4 bytes of 64 byte memory location (‘flags’) will be written
to by the hypervisor at the time of injection. Only first bit of ‘flags’
is currently supported, when set, it indicates that the guest is dealing
with asynchronous ‘page not present’ event. If during a page fault APF
‘flags’ is ‘0’ it means that this is regular page fault. Guest is
supposed to clear ‘flags’ when it is done handling #PF exception so the
next event can be delivered.</p>
<p>Note, since APF ‘page not present’ events use the same exception vector
as regular page fault, guest must reset ‘flags’ to ‘0’ before it does
something that can generate normal page fault.</p>
<p>Bytes 5-7 of 64 byte memory location (‘token’) will be written to by the
hypervisor at the time of APF ‘page ready’ event injection. The content
of these bytes is a token which was previously delivered as ‘page not
present’ event. The event indicates the page in now available. Guest is
supposed to write ‘0’ to ‘token’ when it is done handling ‘page ready’
event and to write 1’ to MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_ACK after clearing the location;
writing to the MSR forces KVM to re-scan its queue and deliver the next
pending notification.</p>
<p>Note, MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_INT MSR specifying the interrupt vector for ‘page
ready’ APF delivery needs to be written to before enabling APF mechanism
in MSR_KVM_ASYNC_PF_EN or interrupt #0 can get injected. The MSR is
available if KVM_FEATURE_ASYNC_PF_INT is present in CPUID.</p>
<p>Note, previously, ‘page ready’ events were delivered via the same #PF
exception as ‘page not present’ events but this is now deprecated. If
bit 3 (interrupt based delivery) is not set APF events are not delivered.</p>
<p>If APF is disabled while there are outstanding APFs, they will
not be delivered.</p>
<p class="last">Currently ‘page ready’ APF events will be always delivered on the
same vcpu as ‘page not present’ event was, but guest should not rely on
that.</p>

<p>whose data will be filled in by the hypervisor periodically. Only one
write, or registration, is needed for each VCPU. The interval between
updates of this structure is arbitrary and implementation-dependent.
The hypervisor may update this structure at any time it sees fit until
anything with bit0 == 0 is written to it. Guest is required to make sure
this structure is initialized to zero.</p>
<p>Fields have the following meanings:</p>
<dl class="last docutils">
<dt>version:</dt>
<dd>a sequence counter. In other words, guest has to check
this field before and after grabbing time information and make
sure they are both equal and even. An odd version indicates an
in-progress update.</dd>
<dt>flags:</dt>
<dd>At this point, always zero. May be used to indicate
changes in this structure in the future.</dd>
<dt>steal:</dt>
<dd>the amount of time in which this vCPU did not run, in
nanoseconds. Time during which the vcpu is idle, will not be
reported as steal time.</dd>
<dt>preempted:</dt>
<dd>indicate the vCPU who owns this struct is running or
not. Non-zero values mean the vCPU has been preempted. Zero
means the vCPU is not preempted. NOTE, it is always zero if the
the hypervisor doesn’t support this field.</dd>

<dt>data:</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Bit 0 is 1 when PV end of interrupt is enabled on the vcpu; 0

interrupt is enabled (bit 0 set), bits 63-2 hold a 4-byte aligned
physical address of a 4 byte memory area which must be in guest RAM and
must be zeroed.</p>
<p>The first, least significant bit of 4 byte memory location will be
written to by the hypervisor, typically at the time of interrupt
injection.  Value of 1 means that guest can skip writing EOI to the apic
(using MSR or MMIO write); instead, it is sufficient to signal
EOI by clearing the bit in guest memory - this location will
later be polled by the hypervisor.
Value of 0 means that the EOI write is required.</p>
<p>It is always safe for the guest to ignore the optimization and perform
the APIC EOI write anyway.</p>
<p>Hypervisor is guaranteed to only modify this least
significant bit while in the current VCPU context, this means that
guest does not need to use either lock prefix or memory ordering
primitives to synchronise with the hypervisor.</p>
<p class="last">However, hypervisor can set and clear this memory bit at any time:
therefore to make sure hypervisor does not interrupt the
guest and clear the least significant bit in the memory area
in the window between guest testing it to detect
whether it can skip EOI apic write and between guest
clearing it to signal EOI to the hypervisor,
guest must both read the least significant bit in the memory area and
clear it using a single CPU instruction, such as test and clear, or
compare and exchange.</p>
