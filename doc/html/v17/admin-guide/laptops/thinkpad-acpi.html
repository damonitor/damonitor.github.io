<p>This is a Linux driver for the IBM and Lenovo ThinkPad laptops. It
supports various features of these laptops which are accessible
through the ACPI and ACPI EC framework, but not otherwise fully
supported by the generic Linux ACPI drivers.</p>
<p>This driver used to be named ibm-acpi until kernel 2.6.21 and release
0.13-20070314.  It used to be in the drivers/acpi tree, but it was
moved to the drivers/misc tree and renamed to thinkpad-acpi for kernel
2.6.22, and release 0.14.  It was moved to drivers/platform/x86 for
kernel 2.6.29 and release 0.22.</p>
<p>The driver is named “thinkpad-acpi”.  In some places, like module
names and log messages, “thinkpad_acpi” is used because of userspace
issues.</p>
<p>“tpacpi” is used as a shorthand where “thinkpad-acpi” would be too
long due to length limitations on some Linux kernel versions.</p>
<div class="section" id="status">
<h2>Status<a class="headerlink" href="#status" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The features currently supported are the following (see below for
detailed description):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Fn key combinations</li>
<li>Bluetooth enable and disable</li>
<li>video output switching, expansion control</li>
<li>ThinkLight on and off</li>
<li>CMOS/UCMS control</li>
<li>LED control</li>
<li>ACPI sounds</li>
<li>temperature sensors</li>
<li>Experimental: embedded controller register dump</li>
<li>LCD brightness control</li>
<li>Volume control</li>
<li>Fan control and monitoring: fan speed, fan enable/disable</li>
<li>WAN enable and disable</li>
<li>UWB enable and disable</li>
<li>LCD Shadow (PrivacyGuard) enable and disable</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>A compatibility table by model and feature is maintained on the web
site, <a class="reference external" href="http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/">http://ibm-acpi.sf.net/</a>. I appreciate any success or failure
reports, especially if they add to or correct the compatibility table.
Please include the following information in your report:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>ThinkPad model name</li>
<li>a copy of your ACPI tables, using the “acpidump” utility</li>
<li>a copy of the output of dmidecode, with serial numbers
and UUIDs masked off</li>
<li>which driver features work and which don’t</li>
<li>the observed behavior of non-working features</li>
</ul>

<p>Any other comments or patches are also more than welcome.</p>

<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you are compiling this driver as included in the Linux kernel
sources, look for the CONFIG_THINKPAD_ACPI Kconfig option.
It is located on the menu path: “Device Drivers” -&gt; “X86 Platform
Specific Device Drivers” -&gt; “ThinkPad ACPI Laptop Extras”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h2>Features<a class="headerlink" href="#features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The driver exports two different interfaces to userspace, which can be
used to access the features it provides.  One is a legacy procfs-based
interface, which will be removed at some time in the future.  The other
is a new sysfs-based interface which is not complete yet.</p>
<p>The procfs interface creates the /proc/acpi/ibm directory.  There is a
file under that directory for each feature it supports.  The procfs
interface is mostly frozen, and will change very little if at all: it
will not be extended to add any new functionality in the driver, instead
all new functionality will be implemented on the sysfs interface.</p>
<p>The sysfs interface tries to blend in the generic Linux sysfs subsystems
and classes as much as possible.  Since some of these subsystems are not
yet ready or stabilized, it is expected that this interface will change,
and any and all userspace programs must deal with it.</p>
<div class="section" id="notes-about-the-sysfs-interface">
<h3>Notes about the sysfs interface<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-about-the-sysfs-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Unlike what was done with the procfs interface, correctness when talking
to the sysfs interfaces will be enforced, as will correctness in the
thinkpad-acpi’s implementation of sysfs interfaces.</p>
<p>Also, any bugs in the thinkpad-acpi sysfs driver code or in the
thinkpad-acpi’s implementation of the sysfs interfaces will be fixed for
maximum correctness, even if that means changing an interface in
non-compatible ways.  As these interfaces mature both in the kernel and
in thinkpad-acpi, such changes should become quite rare.</p>
<p>Applications interfacing to the thinkpad-acpi sysfs interfaces must
follow all sysfs guidelines and correctly process all errors (the sysfs
interface makes extensive use of errors).  File descriptors and open /
close operations to the sysfs inodes must also be properly implemented.</p>
<p>The version of thinkpad-acpi’s sysfs interface is exported by the driver
as a driver attribute (see below).</p>
<p>Sysfs driver attributes are on the driver’s sysfs attribute space,
for 2.6.23+ this is /sys/bus/platform/drivers/thinkpad_acpi/ and
/sys/bus/platform/drivers/thinkpad_hwmon/</p>
<p>Sysfs device attributes are on the thinkpad_acpi device sysfs attribute
space, for 2.6.23+ this is /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_acpi/.</p>
<p>Sysfs device attributes for the sensors and fan are on the
thinkpad_hwmon device’s sysfs attribute space, but you should locate it
looking for a hwmon device with the name attribute of “thinkpad”, or
better yet, through libsensors. For 4.14+ sysfs attributes were moved to the
hwmon device (/sys/bus/platform/devices/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon? or
/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon?).</p>

<p>The sysfs interface version changelog for the driver can be found at the
end of this document.  Changes to the sysfs interface done by the kernel
subsystems are not documented here, nor are they tracked by this
attribute.</p>
<p>Changes to the thinkpad-acpi sysfs interface are only considered
non-experimental when they are submitted to Linux mainline, at which
point the changes in this interface are documented and interface_version
may be updated.  If you are using any thinkpad-acpi features not yet
sent to mainline for merging, you do so on your own risk: these features
may disappear, or be implemented in a different and incompatible way by
the time they are merged in Linux mainline.</p>
<p>Changes that are backwards-compatible by nature (e.g. the addition of
attributes that do not change the way the other attributes work) do not
always warrant an update of interface_version.  Therefore, one must
expect that an attribute might not be there, and deal with it properly
(an attribute not being there <em>is</em> a valid way to make it clear that a
feature is not available in sysfs).</p>

<div class="section" id="hot-keys">
<h2>Hot keys<a class="headerlink" href="#hot-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>procfs: /proc/acpi/ibm/hotkey</p>
<p>sysfs device attribute: hotkey_*</p>
<p>In a ThinkPad, the ACPI HKEY handler is responsible for communicating
some important events and also keyboard hot key presses to the operating
system.  Enabling the hotkey functionality of thinkpad-acpi signals the
firmware that such a driver is present, and modifies how the ThinkPad
firmware will behave in many situations.</p>
<p>The driver enables the HKEY (“hot key”) event reporting automatically
when loaded, and disables it when it is removed.</p>
<p>The driver will report HKEY events in the following format:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ibm/hotkey HKEY 00000080 0000xxxx
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Some of these events refer to hot key presses, but not all of them.</p>
<p>The driver will generate events over the input layer for hot keys and
radio switches, and over the ACPI netlink layer for other events.  The
input layer support accepts the standard IOCTLs to remap the keycodes
assigned to each hot key.</p>
<p>The hot key bit mask allows some control over which hot keys generate
events.  If a key is “masked” (bit set to 0 in the mask), the firmware
will handle it.  If it is “unmasked”, it signals the firmware that
thinkpad-acpi would prefer to handle it, if the firmware would be so
kind to allow it (and it often doesn’t!).</p>
<p>Not all bits in the mask can be modified.  Not all bits that can be
modified do anything.  Not all hot keys can be individually controlled
by the mask.  Some models do not support the mask at all.  The behaviour
of the mask is, therefore, highly dependent on the ThinkPad model.</p>
<p>The driver will filter out any unmasked hotkeys, so even if the firmware
doesn’t allow disabling an specific hotkey, the driver will not report
events for unmasked hotkeys.</p>
<p>Note that unmasking some keys prevents their default behavior.  For
example, if Fn+F5 is unmasked, that key will no longer enable/disable
Bluetooth by itself in firmware.</p>
<p>Note also that not all Fn key combinations are supported through ACPI
depending on the ThinkPad model and firmware version.  On those
ThinkPads, it is still possible to support some extra hotkeys by
polling the “CMOS NVRAM” at least 10 times per second.  The driver
attempts to enables this functionality automatically when required.</p>
<div class="section" id="procfs-notes">
<h3>procfs notes<a class="headerlink" href="#procfs-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following commands can be written to the /proc/acpi/ibm/hotkey file:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo 0xffffffff &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/hotkey -- enable all hot keys
echo 0 &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/hotkey -- disable all possible hot keys
... any other 8-hex-digit mask ...
echo reset &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/hotkey -- restore the recommended mask
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The following commands have been deprecated and will cause the kernel
to log a warning:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo enable &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/hotkey -- does nothing
echo disable &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/hotkey -- returns an error
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The procfs interface does not support NVRAM polling control.  So as to
maintain maximum bug-to-bug compatibility, it does not report any masks,
nor does it allow one to manipulate the hot key mask when the firmware
does not support masks at all, even if NVRAM polling is in use.</p>

<p>The ThinkPad firmware does not allow one to differentiate when most hot
keys are pressed or released (either that, or we don’t know how to, yet).
For these keys, the driver generates a set of events for a key press and
immediately issues the same set of events for a key release.  It is
unknown by the driver if the ThinkPad firmware triggered these events on
hot key press or release, but the firmware will do it for either one, not
both.</p>
<p>If a key is mapped to KEY_RESERVED, it generates no input events at all.
If a key is mapped to KEY_UNKNOWN, it generates an input event that
includes an scan code.  If a key is mapped to anything else, it will
generate input device EV_KEY events.</p>
<p>In addition to the EV_KEY events, thinkpad-acpi may also issue EV_SW
events for switches:</p>

<p>Battery nearly empty alarms are a last resort attempt to get the
operating system to hibernate or shutdown cleanly (0x2313), or shutdown
cleanly (0x2413) before power is lost.  They must be acted upon, as the
wake up caused by the firmware will have negated most safety nets…</p>
<p>When any of the “too hot” alarms happen, according to Lenovo the user
should suspend or hibernate the laptop (and in the case of battery
alarms, unplug the AC adapter) to let it cool down.  These alarms do
signal that something is wrong, they should never happen on normal
operating conditions.</p>
<p>The “extremely hot” alarms are emergencies.  According to Lenovo, the
operating system is to force either an immediate suspend or hibernate
cycle, or a system shutdown.  Obviously, something is very wrong if this
happens.</p>

<p>Automatic video switching can be enabled or disabled.  When automatic
video switching is enabled, certain events (e.g. opening the lid,
docking or undocking) cause the video output device to change
automatically. While this can be useful, it also causes flickering
and, on the X40, video corruption. By disabling automatic switching,
the flickering or video corruption can be avoided.</p>
<p>The video_switch command cycles through the available video outputs
(it simulates the behavior of Fn-F7).</p>
<p>Video expansion can be toggled through this feature. This controls
whether the display is expanded to fill the entire LCD screen when a
mode with less than full resolution is used. Note that the current
video expansion status cannot be determined through this feature.</p>
<p>Note that on many models (particularly those using Radeon graphics
chips) the X driver configures the video card in a way which prevents
Fn-F7 from working. This also disables the video output switching
features of this driver, as it uses the same ACPI methods as
Fn-F7. Video switching on the console should still work.</p>

<p>procfs: /proc/acpi/ibm/cmos</p>
<p>sysfs device attribute: cmos_command</p>
<p>This feature is mostly used internally by the ACPI firmware to keep the legacy
CMOS NVRAM bits in sync with the current machine state, and to record this
state so that the ThinkPad will retain such settings across reboots.</p>
<p>Some of these commands actually perform actions in some ThinkPad models, but
this is expected to disappear more and more in newer models.  As an example, in
a T43 and in a X40, commands 12 and 13 still control the ThinkLight state for
real, but commands 0 to 2 don’t control the mixer anymore (they have been
phased out) and just update the NVRAM.</p>
<p>The range of valid cmos command numbers is 0 to 21, but not all have an
effect and the behavior varies from model to model.  Here is the behavior
on the X40 (tpb is the ThinkPad Buttons utility):</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>0 - Related to “Volume down” key press</li>
<li>1 - Related to “Volume up” key press</li>

<p>Because misuse of the LEDs could induce an unaware user to perform
dangerous actions (like undocking or ejecting a bay device while the

<p>Due to limitations in the sysfs LED class, if the status of the LED
indicators cannot be read due to an error, thinkpad-acpi will report it as
a brightness of zero (same as LED off).</p>
<p>If the thinkpad firmware doesn’t support reading the current status,
trying to read the current LED brightness will just return whatever
brightness was last written to that attribute.</p>
<p>These LEDs can blink using hardware acceleration.  To request that a
ThinkPad indicator LED should blink in hardware accelerated mode, use the
“timer” trigger, and leave the delay_on and delay_off parameters set to
zero (to request hardware acceleration autodetection).</p>

Instead the EC can be accessed through /sys/kernel/debug/ec with
a userspace tool which can be found here:
<a class="reference external" href="ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/trenn/sources/ec">ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/trenn/sources/ec</a></p>

<p>Often fan and temperature values vary between

several quick dumps to eliminate them.</p>
<p>You can use a similar method to figure out the meaning of other

<h2>LCD brightness control<a class="headerlink" href="#lcd-brightness-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>procfs: /proc/acpi/ibm/brightness</p>
<p>sysfs backlight device “thinkpad_screen”</p>
<p>This feature allows software control of the LCD brightness on ThinkPad
models which don’t have a hardware brightness slider.</p>
<p>It has some limitations: the LCD backlight cannot be actually turned
on or off by this interface, it just controls the backlight brightness
level.</p>
<p>On IBM (and some of the earlier Lenovo) ThinkPads, the backlight control
has eight brightness levels, ranging from 0 to 7.  Some of the levels
may not be distinct.  Later Lenovo models that implement the ACPI
display backlight brightness control methods have 16 levels, ranging
from 0 to 15.</p>
<p>For IBM ThinkPads, there are two interfaces to the firmware for direct
brightness control, EC and UCMS (or CMOS).  To select which one should be
used, use the brightness_mode module parameter: brightness_mode=1 selects
EC mode, brightness_mode=2 selects UCMS mode, brightness_mode=3 selects EC
mode with NVRAM backing (so that brightness changes are remembered across
shutdown/reboot).</p>
<p>The driver tries to select which interface to use from a table of
defaults for each ThinkPad model.  If it makes a wrong choice, please
report this as a bug, so that we can fix it.</p>
<p>Lenovo ThinkPads only support brightness_mode=2 (UCMS).</p>
<p>When display backlight brightness controls are available through the
standard ACPI interface, it is best to use it instead of this direct
ThinkPad-specific interface.  The driver will disable its native
backlight brightness control interface if it detects that the standard
ACPI interface is available in the ThinkPad.</p>
<p>If you want to use the thinkpad-acpi backlight brightness control
instead of the generic ACPI video backlight brightness control for some
reason, you should use the acpi_backlight=vendor kernel parameter.</p>
<p>The brightness_enable module parameter can be used to control whether
the LCD brightness control feature will be enabled when available.
brightness_enable=0 forces it to be disabled.  brightness_enable=1
forces it to be enabled when available, even if the standard ACPI
interface is also available.</p>

<p>procfs: /proc/acpi/ibm/volume</p>
<p>ALSA: “ThinkPad Console Audio Control”, default ID: “ThinkPadEC”</p>
<p>NOTE: by default, the volume control interface operates in read-only
mode, as it is supposed to be used for on-screen-display purposes.
The read/write mode can be enabled through the use of the
“volume_control=1” module parameter.</p>
<p>NOTE: distros are urged to not enable volume_control by default, this
should be done by the local admin only.  The ThinkPad UI is for the
console audio control to be done through the volume keys only, and for
the desktop environment to just provide on-screen-display feedback.
Software volume control should be done only in the main AC97/HDA
mixer.</p>
<div class="section" id="about-the-thinkpad-console-audio-control">
<h3>About the ThinkPad Console Audio control<a class="headerlink" href="#about-the-thinkpad-console-audio-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ThinkPads have a built-in amplifier and muting circuit that drives the
console headphone and speakers.  This circuit is after the main AC97
or HDA mixer in the audio path, and under exclusive control of the
firmware.</p>
<p>ThinkPads have three special hotkeys to interact with the console
audio control: volume up, volume down and mute.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the normal way the mute function works (on
ThinkPads that do not have a “mute LED”) is:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Press mute to mute.  It will <em>always</em> mute, you can press it as
many times as you want, and the sound will remain mute.</li>
<li>Press either volume key to unmute the ThinkPad (it will _not_
change the volume, it will just unmute).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a very superior design when compared to the cheap software-only
mute-toggle solution found on normal consumer laptops:  you can be
absolutely sure the ThinkPad will not make noise if you press the mute
button, no matter the previous state.</p>
<p>The IBM ThinkPads, and the earlier Lenovo ThinkPads have variable-gain
amplifiers driving the speakers and headphone output, and the firmware
also handles volume control for the headphone and speakers on these
ThinkPads without any help from the operating system (this volume
control stage exists after the main AC97 or HDA mixer in the audio
path).</p>
<p>The newer Lenovo models only have firmware mute control, and depend on
the main HDA mixer to do volume control (which is done by the operating
system).  In this case, the volume keys are filtered out for unmute
key press (there are some firmware bugs in this area) and delivered as
normal key presses to the operating system (thinkpad-acpi is not
involved).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-thinkpad-acpi-volume-control">
<h3>The ThinkPad-ACPI volume control<a class="headerlink" href="#the-thinkpad-acpi-volume-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The preferred way to interact with the Console Audio control is the
ALSA interface.</p>
<p>The legacy procfs interface allows one to read the current state,
and if volume control is enabled, accepts the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo up   &gt;/proc/acpi/ibm/volume
echo down &gt;/proc/acpi/ibm/volume
echo mute &gt;/proc/acpi/ibm/volume
echo unmute &gt;/proc/acpi/ibm/volume
echo &#39;level &lt;level&gt;&#39; &gt;/proc/acpi/ibm/volume
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The &lt;level&gt; number range is 0 to 14 although not all of them may be
distinct. To unmute the volume after the mute command, use either the
up or down command (the level command will not unmute the volume), or
the unmute command.</p>
<p>You can use the volume_capabilities parameter to tell the driver
whether your thinkpad has volume control or mute-only control:
volume_capabilities=1 for mixers with mute and volume control,
volume_capabilities=2 for mixers with only mute control.</p>
<p>If the driver misdetects the capabilities for your ThinkPad model,
please report this to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ibm-acpi-devel&#37;&#52;&#48;lists&#46;sourceforge&#46;net">ibm-acpi-devel<span>&#64;</span>lists<span>&#46;</span>sourceforge<span>&#46;</span>net</a>, so that we
can update the driver.</p>
<p>There are two strategies for volume control.  To select which one
should be used, use the volume_mode module parameter: volume_mode=1
selects EC mode, and volume_mode=3 selects EC mode with NVRAM backing
(so that volume/mute changes are remembered across shutdown/reboot).</p>
<p>The driver will operate in volume_mode=3 by default. If that does not
work well on your ThinkPad model, please report this to
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:ibm-acpi-devel&#37;&#52;&#48;lists&#46;sourceforge&#46;net">ibm-acpi-devel<span>&#64;</span>lists<span>&#46;</span>sourceforge<span>&#46;</span>net</a>.</p>
<p>The driver supports the standard ALSA module parameters.  If the ALSA
mixer is disabled, the driver will disable all volume functionality.</p>

</dl>
<p>This feature attempts to show the current fan speed, control mode and
other fan data that might be available.  The speed is read directly
from the hardware registers of the embedded controller.  This is known
to work on later R, T, X and Z series ThinkPads but may show a bogus
value on other models.</p>
<p>Some Lenovo ThinkPads support a secondary fan.  This fan cannot be
controlled separately, it shares the main fan control.</p>
<div class="section" id="fan-levels">
<h3>Fan levels<a class="headerlink" href="#fan-levels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most ThinkPad fans work in “levels” at the firmware interface.  Level 0
stops the fan.  The higher the level, the higher the fan speed, although
adjacent levels often map to the same fan speed.  7 is the highest
level, where the fan reaches the maximum recommended speed.</p>
<p>Level “auto” means the EC changes the fan level according to some
internal algorithm, usually based on readings from the thermal sensors.</p>
<p>There is also a “full-speed” level, also known as “disengaged” level.
In this level, the EC disables the speed-locked closed-loop fan control,
and drives the fan as fast as it can go, which might exceed hardware
limits, so use this level with caution.</p>
<p>The fan usually ramps up or down slowly from one speed to another, and
it is normal for the EC to take several seconds to react to fan
commands.  The full-speed level may take up to two minutes to ramp up to
maximum speed, and in some ThinkPads, the tachometer readings go stale
while the EC is transitioning to the full-speed level.</p>
<p>WARNING WARNING WARNING: do not leave the fan disabled unless you are
monitoring all of the temperature sensor readings and you are ready to
enable it if necessary to avoid overheating.</p>
<p>An enabled fan in level “auto” may stop spinning if the EC decides the
ThinkPad is cool enough and doesn’t need the extra airflow.  This is
normal, and the EC will spin the fan up if the various thermal readings
rise too much.</p>
<p>On the X40, this seems to depend on the CPU and HDD temperatures.
Specifically, the fan is turned on when either the CPU temperature
climbs to 56 degrees or the HDD temperature climbs to 46 degrees.  The
fan is turned off when the CPU temperature drops to 49 degrees and the
HDD temperature drops to 41 degrees.  These thresholds cannot
currently be controlled.</p>
<p>The ThinkPad’s ACPI DSDT code will reprogram the fan on its own when
certain conditions are met.  It will override any fan programming done
through thinkpad-acpi.</p>
<p>The thinkpad-acpi kernel driver can be programmed to revert the fan
level to a safe setting if userspace does not issue one of the procfs
fan commands: “enable”, “disable”, “level” or “watchdog”, or if there
are no writes to pwm1_enable (or to pwm1 <em>if and only if</em> pwm1_enable is
set to 1, manual mode) within a configurable amount of time of up to
120 seconds.  This functionality is called fan safety watchdog.</p>
<p>Note that the watchdog timer stops after it enables the fan.  It will be
rearmed again automatically (using the same interval) when one of the
above mentioned fan commands is received.  The fan watchdog is,
therefore, not suitable to protect against fan mode changes made through
means other than the “enable”, “disable”, and “level” procfs fan
commands, or the hwmon fan control sysfs interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id11">
<h3>Procfs notes<a class="headerlink" href="#id11" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The fan may be enabled or disabled with the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo enable  &gt;/proc/acpi/ibm/fan
echo disable &gt;/proc/acpi/ibm/fan
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Placing a fan on level 0 is the same as disabling it.  Enabling a fan
will try to place it in a safe level if it is too slow or disabled.</p>
<p>The fan level can be controlled with the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo &#39;level &lt;level&gt;&#39; &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where &lt;level&gt; is an integer from 0 to 7, or one of the words “auto” or
“full-speed” (without the quotes).  Not all ThinkPads support the “auto”
and “full-speed” levels.  The driver accepts “disengaged” as an alias for
“full-speed”, and reports it as “disengaged” for backwards
compatibility.</p>
<p>On the X31 and X40 (and ONLY on those models), the fan speed can be
controlled to a certain degree.  Once the fan is running, it can be
forced to run faster or slower with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo &#39;speed &lt;speed&gt;&#39; &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/fan
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The sustainable range of fan speeds on the X40 appears to be from about
3700 to about 7350. Values outside this range either do not have any
effect or the fan speed eventually settles somewhere in that range.  The
fan cannot be stopped or started with this command.  This functionality
is incomplete, and not available through the sysfs interface.</p>
<p>To program the safety watchdog, use the “watchdog” command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo &#39;watchdog &lt;interval in seconds&gt;&#39; &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

<h2>Multiple Commands, Module Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-commands-module-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Multiple commands can be written to the proc files in one shot by
separating them with commas, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo enable,0xffff &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/hotkey
echo lcd_disable,crt_enable &gt; /proc/acpi/ibm/video
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Commands can also be specified when loading the thinkpad-acpi module,
for example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>modprobe thinkpad_acpi hotkey=enable,0xffff video=auto_disable
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enabling-debugging-output">
<h2>Enabling debugging output<a class="headerlink" href="#enabling-debugging-output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The module takes a debug parameter which can be used to selectively
enable various classes of debugging output, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>modprobe thinkpad_acpi debug=0xffff
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>will enable all debugging output classes.  It takes a bitmask, so
to enable more than one output class, just add their values.</p>

<p>There is also a kernel build option to enable more debugging
information, which may be necessary to debug driver problems.</p>
<p>The level of debugging information output by the driver can be changed
at runtime through sysfs, using the driver attribute debug_level.  The
attribute takes the same bitmask as the debug module parameter above.</p>

<h2>Force loading of module<a class="headerlink" href="#force-loading-of-module" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If thinkpad-acpi refuses to detect your ThinkPad, you can try to specify
the module parameter force_load=1.  Regardless of whether this works or
not, please contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ibm-acpi-devel&#37;&#52;&#48;lists&#46;sourceforge&#46;net">ibm-acpi-devel<span>&#64;</span>lists<span>&#46;</span>sourceforge<span>&#46;</span>net</a> with a report.</p>
