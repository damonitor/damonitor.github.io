<h1>LED Transient Trigger<a class="headerlink" href="#led-transient-trigger" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The leds timer trigger does not currently have an interface to activate
a one shot timer. The current support allows for setting two timers, one for
specifying how long a state to be on, and the second for how long the state
to be off. The delay_on value specifies the time period an LED should stay
in on state, followed by a delay_off value that specifies how long the LED
should stay in off state. The on and off cycle repeats until the trigger
gets deactivated. There is no provision for one time activation to implement
features that require an on or off state to be held just once and then stay in
the original state forever.</p>
<p>Without one shot timer interface, user space can still use timer trigger to
set a timer to hold a state, however when user space application crashes or
goes away without deactivating the timer, the hardware will be left in that
state permanently.</p>
<p>As a specific example of this use-case, let’s look at vibrate feature on
phones. Vibrate function on phones is implemented using PWM pins on SoC or
PMIC. There is a need to activate one shot timer to control the vibrate
feature, to prevent user space crashes leaving the phone in vibrate mode
permanently causing the battery to drain.</p>
<p>Transient trigger addresses the need for one shot timer activation. The
transient trigger can be enabled and disabled just like the other leds
triggers.</p>
<p>When an led class device driver registers itself, it can specify all leds
triggers it supports and a default trigger. During registration, activation
routine for the default trigger gets called. During registration of an led
class device, the LED state does not change.</p>
<p>When the driver unregisters, deactivation routine for the currently active
trigger will be called, and LED state is changed to LED_OFF.</p>
<p>Driver suspend changes the LED state to LED_OFF and resume doesn’t change
the state. Please note that there is no explicit interaction between the
suspend and resume actions and the currently enabled trigger. LED state
changes are suspended while the driver is in suspend state. Any timers
that are active at the time driver gets suspended, continue to run, without
being able to actually change the LED state. Once driver is resumed, triggers
start functioning again.</p>
<p>LED state changes are controlled using brightness which is a common led
class device property. When brightness is set to 0 from user space via
echo 0 &gt; brightness, it will result in deactivating the current trigger.</p>
<p>Transient trigger uses standard register and unregister interfaces. During
trigger registration, for each led class device that specifies this trigger
as its default trigger, trigger activation routine will get called. During
registration, the LED state does not change, unless there is another trigger
active, in which case LED state changes to LED_OFF.</p>
<p>During trigger unregistration, LED state gets changed to LED_OFF.</p>
<p>Transient trigger activation routine doesn’t change the LED state. It
creates its properties and does its initialization. Transient trigger
deactivation routine, will cancel any timer that is active before it cleans
up and removes the properties it created. It will restore the LED state to
non-transient state. When driver gets suspended, irrespective of the transient
state, the LED state changes to LED_OFF.</p>
<p>Transient trigger can be enabled and disabled from user space on led class
devices, that support this trigger as shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>echo transient &gt; trigger
echo none &gt; trigger

</div>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>NOTE:</dt>
<dd>Add a new property trigger state to control the state.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This trigger exports three properties, activate, state, and duration. When
transient trigger is activated these properties are set to default values.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">duration allows setting timer value in msecs. The initial value is 0.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">activate allows activating and deactivating the timer specified by
duration as needed. The initial and default value is 0.  This will allow
duration to be set after trigger activation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">state allows user to specify a transient state to be held for the specified
duration.</p>
<blockquote>

</ul>

<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>one shot timer value. When activate is set, duration value

<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>transient state to be held. It has two values 0 or 1. 0 maps
to LED_OFF and 1 maps to LED_FULL. The specified state is
held for the duration of the one shot timer and then the
state gets changed to the non-transient state which is the
inverse of transient state.
If state = LED_FULL, when the timer runs out the state will
go back to LED_OFF.
If state = LED_OFF, when the timer runs out the state will
go back to LED_FULL.
Please note that current LED state is not checked prior to
changing the state to the specified state.
Driver could map these values to inverted depending on the
default states it defines for the LED in its brightness_set()
interface which is called from the led brightness_set()
interfaces to control the LED state.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When timer expires activate goes back to deactivated state, duration is left
at the set value to be used when activate is set at a future time. This will
allow user app to set the time once and activate it to run it once for the
specified value as needed. When timer expires, state is restored to the
non-transient state which is the inverse of the transient state:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Control of vibrate (phones, tablets etc.) hardware by user space app.</li>

the LED will be extinguished automatically.</li>
<li>Use by any user space app that needs a transient GPIO output.</li>
