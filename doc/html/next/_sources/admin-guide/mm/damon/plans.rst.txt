============
Future Plans
============

DAMON is still on its first stage.  Below plans are still under development.


Automate Data Access Monitoring-based Memory Operation Schemes Execution
========================================================================

The ultimate goal of DAMON is being used as a building block of the data access
pattern aware kernel memory management subsystem optimization.  However, as
always, some users having very special workloads will want to do their own
optimization.  DAMON will automate most of the tasks for such manual
optimizations in near future.  Users will be required to only describe what
kind of data access pattern based operation schemes they want in simple form.

By applying a very simple scheme for THP promotion/demotion with a prototype
implementation, DAMON reduced 60% of THP memory footprint overhead while
preserving 50% of the THP performance benefit.  The detailed results can be
seen in an external web page [1]_.

Several RFC patchsets for this plan is available [2]_.


Support Various Address Spaces
==============================

Currently, DAMON supports only virtual memory address spaces because it
utilizes PTE Accessed bits as its low level access check primitive.  However,
the core design of DAMON is in separated higher layer.  In a future, therefore,
DAMON will entirely decouple those layers and make the lower level configurable
so that it can support various address spaces including physical memory.  The
configuration will be highly flexible so that users can assemble the primitives
implemented by themselves for their special usecase.

Monitoring of clean/dirty/entire page cache, NUMA nodes, specific files, or
block devices would be examples of such usecases.

An RFC patchset for this plan is available [3]_.
