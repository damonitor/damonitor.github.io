DAMON: Data Access MONitor
==========================

Introduction
============

Optimal placement of each data object under accurate future data access pattern
predictions is one of the biggest and important goal of the memory management.
However, most of the predictions rely on only coarse information to keep the
instrumentation overhead minimal.  As a consequence, a number of memory
management optimization works consistently say the predictions are far from the
optimal.  However, none of those works has successfully adopted into the Linux
kernel mainly due to the absence of the scalable instrumentation solution.
That is, the instrumentation overhead can arbitrarily increase as the size of
target workload grows.

DAMON is a data access monitoring subsystem that designed to mitigate the
problem.  Therefore, DAMON users can efficiently collect the fine data access
pattern and effectiely optimize their memory management mechanisms via the
pattern based predictions.

Unlike the other mechanisms for data access monitoring, DAMON is

- *accurate* enough to be used for the DRAM level memory management,
- *light-weight* so that it can be applied online and
- *scalable* to wide area of workloads as it allow users to set upper-bound of
  the overhead regardless of the size of target workloads.

This three characteristics are available due to it's core mechanisms called
'regions based sampling' and 'adaptive regions adjustment'.  Refer to
:doc:`mechanisms` for detail.
