Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Why a new module, instead of extending perf or other user space tools?
======================================================================

First, DAMON aims to be used by other programs including the kernel.
Therefore, having dependency to specific tools like perf is not desirable.
Second, because it needs to be lightweight as much as possible so that it can
be used online, any unnecessary overhead such as kernel - user space context
switching cost should be avoided.  These are the two most biggest reasons why
DAMON is implemented in the kernel space.
  

Can 'idle pages tracking' or 'perf mem' substitute DAMON?
=========================================================

Idle page tracking is a low level primitive for access check of each physical
page frame.  'perf mem' is similar, though it can use sampling to minimize the
overhead.  DAMON is a higher level framework for access pattern of data objects
that focused on memory management optimization and providing sophisticated
features for that including the overhead handling.  Therefore, 'idle pages
tracking' and 'perf mem' could provide a subset of DAMON's output, but cannot
substitute DAMON.  Rather than that, DAMON could use those as it's low level
primitives.


Does DAMON supports virtual memory only?
========================================

For now, yes.  But, DAMON will be able to support various address spaces
including physical memory in near future.  Please refer :doc:`plans` for
detailed plan for this.
