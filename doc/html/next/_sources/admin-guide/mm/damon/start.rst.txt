Getting Started
===============

This document briefly describes how you can use the main features of DAMON by
demonstrating use of a DAMON user space tool.  Please note that this document
describes only a part of the features for brevity.  Refer to :doc:`usage` for
the full description.


Prerequisites
=============

DAMON-enabled Kernel
--------------------

You should first ensure your system is running on a kernel built with
``CONFIG_DAMON``.  If the value is set as ``m``, you should load the module
first::

    # modprobe damon


DAMO: DAMON Operator
--------------------

For the demonstration, we will use DAMON Operator (DAMO), the reference
implementation of the DAMON user space tool.  It is located at
``tools/damon/damo`` of the kernel source tree.  We assume that you set
``$PATH`` to point it.  The ``$PATH`` setting is not mandatory, though.

Because DAMO is using the debugfs interface (refer to :doc:`usage` for the
detail) of DAMON, you should also ensure debugfs is mounted.  Mount it manually
as below::

    # mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug/

or append below line to your ``/etc/fstab`` file so that your system can
automatically mount debugfs from next booting::

    debugfs /sys/kernel/debug debugfs defaults 0 0


Recording Data Access Patterns
==============================

Below commands record memory access pattern of an artifical memory access
generator program in a binary file, ``damon.data``.  The program will access
two 100 MiB memory regions in rotation.::

    $ git clone https://github.com/sjp38/masim
    $ cd masim; make; ./masim ./configs/zigzag.cfg
    $ damo record -o damon.data $(pidof masim)


Visualizing The Recorded Access Patterns
========================================

Below three commands visualizes the recorded access patterns file into three
image files, namely ``access_pattern_heatmap.png``, ``wss_dist.png`` and
``wss_chron_change.png``.::

    $ damo report heats --heatmap access_pattern_heatmap.png
    $ damo report wss --range 0 101 1 --plot wss_dist.png
    $ damo report wss --range 0 101 1 --sortby time --plot wss_chron_change.png

``access_pattern_heatmap.png`` will show the data access pattern in heatmap,
which shows when (x-axis) what memory region (y-axis) is how frequently
accessed (color).
``wss_dist.png`` will show the distribution of the working set size.
``wss_chron_change.png`` will show how the working set size has chronologically
changed.

Below are the three images made by above commands.
You can show those made with other realistic workloads at external web pages
[1]_, [2]_, and [3]_.
